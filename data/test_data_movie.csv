"finding the courage to face life full - on is a difficult task .
summoning up the audacity to fall in love is a harder job .
if you 're a total jerk like melvin udall is , the odds are even more against you .
melvin ( jack nicholson ) is a successful romance author who is just the opposite of what you would expect someone in that profession to be .
a solitary man hidden away in his new york apartment with no human interaction and not even a hint of ever having been in a passionate relationship , he avoids the outside world as much as possible .
his obsessive - compulsive disorder rules his life as he uses several different bars of soap to wash his hands and refuses to step on a crack on the sidewalk .
( there 's a great scene when he has to cross a floor made of mosaic tiles -- _ very_small _ mosaic tiles . )
melvin has some great lines .
when his publisher 's receptionist asks him how he writes women so well in his books , he responds "" i think of men and i take away reason and accountability .
"" do n't get him wrong , he 's not merely a misogynist .
setting his sights higher than that , he 's also a homophobe , racist , anti - semite , xenophobe , animal - hater and intensely dislikes people who talk in metaphors .
when we first meet him , he 's busy dumping a neighbor 's dog down the garbage chute .
he 's an equal opportunity bigot .
he does venture outside his apartment every day to eat breakfast at a local cafe .
melvin is such a grouchy curmudgeon that waitress carol connelly ( helen hunt ) is the only one willing to wait on him .
and she 's none too happy about it .
when carol does n't show up for work , melvin 's routine is shot and he 's determined to do something about it .
tracking down her address , he shows up at her place begging her to come back to work so that he can eat breakfast .
the fact that she 's a poor single mother caring for a chronically ill son does n't appear to phase him , he wants his food .
much more upsetting is that his gay artist neighbor simon bishop ( greg kinnear ) is brutally attacked during a robbery .
this does n't upset melvin much ( "" do n't worry , you 'll be back on your knees in no time "" ) but when he is bullied into taking care of simon 's dog , his life is turned topsy - turvey .
melvin is sequestered because he 's afraid of what 's out there on the other side of his apartment door .
he has to make sure it 's ritualistically locked three times to keep the world on its proper side .
when he brings the dog home he reluctantly grows fond of it , talking to it and taking it everywhere
he goes .
this little crack in his emotional armor opens him up .
hiding behind his need for carol to return to work so she can serve him , he pays for a specialist to treat her son .
he even develops a friendship with simon .
all three people are heavily damaged .
melvin has retreated from life in his apartment .
carol has devoted herself to her son , convinced that she has to give up her life for him .
simon is estranged from his parents and his friends disappear when he is hospitalized and his money runs out .
a more unlikely trio to form relationships , you 'd rarely see .
and in the midst of it all , there are some wonderful moments .
melvin is hilarious in his grouchiness and touching as he attempts to be nice .
""
you make me want to be a better man , "" he tells her .
one of the best aspects is that even as he opens up , he is still a curmudgeon .
carol
, afraid that his monetary contribution to the wellness of her son hides a hidden agenda rushes over to his apartment in the rain to explain in no uncertain terms that she will never sleep with him .
it only takes her a second to realize that she is delivering that statement while looking as if she just left a wet t - shirt contest .
there 's hardly anything left to say about jack nicholson .
i do n't remember ever seeing him in anything less than a stellar performance and his over - the - edge melvin is no disappointment .
nicholson may be the best actor working today .
hunt does a commendable job matching nicholson 's energy .
she is n't afraid to be seen as something less than a babe and her portrayal of exhausted run - down carol struggling with seemingly overwhelming obligations is top - notch .
their on - screen chemistry is a bit odd .
each does a wonderful job with the character , but together , there 's something a little off .
it 's a minor problem : they do work well together , but that missing element is what prevents this from being a four - star film .

"ladies and gentlemen , 1997 's independence day is here !
it 's title : starship troopers .
and surprisingly , it is more entertaining than id4 .
i realize that i gave last year 's
sci - fi hit a 4 star rating , but i was under the spell of the powerful first hour .
after subsequent viewings , i feel that independence day really was n't as great as it seemed -- though i still give it a positive review .
starship troopers , on the other hand , has a mocking sense of humor , knowing perfectly well how ridiculous it may seem . as a result , starship troopers is a more exciting , energetic , and lively science fiction film .
in fact , i probably could never get tired of watching this film .
starship troopers is very reminiscient of star wars , another kick - ass space opera which reinvented the sci - fi drama altogether .
while starship troopers is no star wars , it comes quite close , and the easiest assessment would be to call this film : "" the ' star wars ' of the 90s .
"" am i being to generous to this film ?
perhaps , but when a science fiction film comes along that can mix humor and romance , effectively , into the warring races .
in essence , this is the science fiction equivolence of pulp fiction .
the easiest way to write a review of this film would be to compare it to other science fiction films , and i may have to .
starship troopers is not quite an original film persay , but director paul verhoeven gives the film a "" kick - the - aliens'-asses "" style .
id4 had this same style , except it was forced , most likely the cause of will smith having a major role .
this new "" star wars "" has a very simple , basic plot : mankind vs .
an alien species .
the alien species in question here is the bugs , a seemingly advanced civilization of arachnid - type insects .
however , the underlying morals of starship troopers are fleshed out with deadly accuracy .
sometimes the morals are buried by the bloody violence and intense action scenes , but during quiet moments , we realize that starship troopers has something to tell us about our civilization .
more than likely , these morals will be overpowered and quickly forgotten by the time the movie ends .
and they should be .
i doubt verhoeven intended this film to be a thought - provoking film .
this is an "" event "" film , but surprisingly above average .
it is extremely refreshing to watch a sci - fi war film , and actually root for the human side ( something independence day never achieved ) .
starship troopers begins with a satirical portrayal of those strange "" join the army "" ads .
mixing a web - based interface , these summations of events are refreshingly original . stating , "" would you like to know more ? "" , these short news bulletins give the film an immediate sense of humor , and we know we should not take it seriously .
however , we also witness the murder of several troopers in battle , in a gory , yet funny , way .
after witnessing the slaughter , the film jumps back one year , to setup what we just saw .
we are introduced to johnny rico ( casper van dien ) and carmen ibanez ( denise richards ) .
rico flirts with carmen by sending her messages over computer terminals in school classrooms .
however , carmen is n't as interested in rico as she is in becoming a pilot .
however , another classmate , dizzy flores ( dina meyer ) , has her eye on rico .
unfortunately , rico is n't interested in dizzy .
this setup is rather cliched , as is the result of the setup , but it still is fun to watch .
carmen signs up to become a starship trooper , and as a result , rico signs up .
and as a result , dizzy signs up .
everyone is assigned a certain position in the academy : carmen gets the pilot position she wanted , carl jenkins ( neil patrick harris ) , a psychic , gets a position in the training program , and rico is left in the lowest class of the starship troopers : the mobile infantry .
the main story follows rico through his trials and relationships .
in reality , i found myself watching a space version of "" melrose place , "" but with better special effects .
an hour into the film , the war begins .
a sense of tension grew in the audience
i watched this film with .
the first hour may have been a funny ( sometimes unintentionally ) setup , but we grew to care for the flat characters , because no matter how hard i tried not to like the characters , their gorgeous looks won me over ( call me superficial , if you must ) .
following the training sessions , which had many dramas in themselves ( too many to mention here ) , the troopers are sent to war .
the bugs live on the planet klendathu , a planet which consists of dirt and rock , and pretty much nothing else .
many dramas occur during the war , until finally the troopers realize that their is something behind the bugs ' attacks .
a sort of intelligence which masterminds the defense .
the troopers are ordered to locate the "" brain "" and capture it .
i hopefully left the plot as vague as possible , because starship troopers is not about plot .
it 's about special effects and gory violence .
director verhoeven , most known for his nudie film showgirls and basic instinct , returns to his sci - fi days , which gave us good films like total recall .
verhoeven likes to push the envelope of the mpaa , but despite all the violence , the comic book feel gives the film a sense of falsehood .
starship troopers is extremely violent , with more gore than this year 's event horizon .
the r rating is well deserved , and hopefully parents will not allow their 12 year old children to see it .
my guess is that verhoeven 's target audience is the 18 to 25 male group .
the film has a testosterone level off the charts , with chiseled men and beautiful women .
despite these superficial elements , starship troopers also creates a world which made star wars so successful .
while watching the film , we never second guess the character 's decisions because they seem perfectly clear .
thankfully , no hero is punching aliens in the face , which gives the flat characters some depth for which we can identify with .
the cast of starship troopers is quite annoying to begin with , but they soon grow on you .
casper van dien has the chiseled facial features and tan skin which will make most girls swoon .
to most guys , he will come across as artificial .
fortunately , van dien is the worst of the cast , despite how hard he tries to come off as a real character .
dina meyer does a much better job of fleshing out her character .
her dizzy is extremely likeable .
denise richards also does a good job , and her scenes are very well done .
jake busey , gary busey 's son , gives a wonderfully funny performance , and provides one of the biggest laughs of the film .
neil patrick harris
( remember , he was doogie howser )
is a little wooden , and slightly out of place with the rest of the cast . however ,
he does give a good performance .
michael ironside gives the best performance of the film as the teacher with one arm .
his performance rises above the rest .
perhaps it is because his character is the most developed , but i think it is just ironside 's presence on screen .
unfortunately , no particular cast member gives a star - making performance , which is too bad because the material here could have made many of the cast members stars
.
director verhoeven is the main star of the film .
his direction is fast and unrelentless .
he never slows down his pace , which makes for a wild ride .
writer edward neumeier adapted the screenplay from the book by robert heinlein .
the writing is usually very funny , and sometimes very corny .
the dialogue is smart but not too smart .
we are n't required to know everything , but some plot holes are left unanswered .
thankfully we are not intended to notice , and we really do n't ( except for one which lingered in my mind for quite a while ) .
amazingly , with all the wars and romance going on , the screenplay manages to include some surprising governmental issues .
in fact , these governmental changes seem fairly plausible , and this adds another layer to the story .
the moral debate of the characters is quite surprising to find in a film of this genre , but what is even more surprising is the amount of humor included into all the carnage .
i have n't laughed this loud , even in some comedies .
oh , and the special effects are first rate .
starship troopers is rated r for graphic sci - fi violence and gore , and for some language and nudity .
believe me when i say this : do n't take young kids to see this film .
it is extremely violent .
in fact , it is probably the most violent film out this year .
however , if you are old enough ( over 17 ) to see it , starship troopers is guaranteed to entertain .
it 's been a long time since i have cheered for the heros , while also cheering for the bad guys .
and still , it is my dream to see a sci - fi film in which the alien race destroys mankind , and take over the world .
now that would be entertaining !",1,"['these summations of events are refreshingly original', 'a more exciting , energetic , and lively science fiction film . in fact , i probably could never get tired of watching this film', 'the special effects are first rate', 'can mix humor and romance , effectively', 'he does give a good performance', 'is guaranteed to entertain', 'the material here could have made many of the cast members stars', 'with better special effects', 'a wonderfully funny performance , and provides one of the biggest laughs of the film', 'has a mocking sense of humor , knowing perfectly', 'thankfully', 'the dialogue is smart', 'the best performance of the film', 'it is more entertaining', 'extremely likeable', 'they soon grow on you', 'his performance rises above the rest', 'the writing is usually very funny', 'his direction is fast and unrelentless . he never slows down his pace , which makes for a wild ride', 'also does a good job , and her scenes are very well done', 'does a much better job']"
"i was pleasantly surprised by this film .
with a budget topping $ 200 million , i was quite skeptical about whether throwing all that money toward one of the twentieth century 's greatest tragedies would make a film exciting enough to see .
how much could you dress up the sets ?
how many models and computer effects could you use ? how much more action could you pack into a ship that sinks ?
oh , if i 've just given away part of the plot for you , go back to school .
after having viewed titanic , however , i found it to be a well - paced , well - designed , and overall well - made movie .
there have been many films made about the maiden and final voyage of the ocean liner titanic , but this latest offering from director james cameron is the best i 've seen .
titanic tells its story in two time periods .
it starts out in the present , when ocean explorer brock lovett ( bill paxton ) and his team are exploring the wreckage of the titanic on the floor of the atlantic , searching for a priceless diamond necklace which supposedly went down with the ship .
what they find instead is a drawing of a woman wearing the necklace , which is broadcast on the news .
the woman in the picture recognizes herself and phones lovett , who has her flown out to his exploration vessel on the high seas .
there she tells her story to lovett and his team .
in 1912 , rose dewitt bukater ( kate winslett ) , a young lady belonging to society 's upper class , boards the titanic for the ship 's first atlantic crossing , from southampton , england to new york .
she is engaged to cal hockley ( billy zane ) , an heir to old money , and a snob in every sense of the word .
on board , rose feels the stifling trappings of high - society 's expectations , and resolves to escape from it all by throwing herself off the titanic 's stern , but is saved from her self - proclaimed fate by jack dawson ( leonardo dicaprio ) , a passenger in third - class ( "" steerage "" , as it 's referred to ) , who talks her out of jumping .
although for rose the attraction is not immediate , a love affair soon develops between the two , which endangers rose 's social standing as well as her engagement to the jealous cal .
the story sounds very simple , and perhaps even unexciting , but through solid performances by the leads and good direction by cameron , a good movie comes through .
dicaprio is marvelous as the young , but worldly - wise jack , playing the role with the confidence usually found in older actors .
his is a character that is immediately likable , as he knows what he wants out of life and is charmingly able to handle a variety of situations .
girls are going to swoon over him .
winslet also proves herself a good actress , delivering her lines convincingly , and the quality of performances between winslet and dicaprio makes the relationship believable .
the only problem with winslet is that she does not carry herself in accordance with her character 's upbringing .
simply by judgment of her gait , i was distracted from the fact that she was supposed to be an upper - crust debutante .
rather than demonstrate the poise one would expect her character to possess , she sometimes looks positively clumsy , and it unfortunately detracts from her
otherwise great acting .
billy zane is cast well as the aristocratic snob cal , since he has a certain look that immediately makes you want to hate him .
his features are such that even when he smiles , there 's something mistrustful about him , and when he scowls , he is evil incarnate .
he 's something like a porcelain version of peter gallagher , but a cheaper model .
like dicaprio and winslet , zane slips comfortably into his role and plays it well
.
backing up zane is david warner as lovejoy , cal 's personal assistant ( or "" man "" as they said at the turn of the century ) .
no matter who else is in the cast , you can always count on a good performance by warner , who seems to be made to play the distinguished gentleman with a gaze of steel and will to match .
additionally , there are a number of smaller fictional and non - fictional roles thrown in for color , such as kathy bates as "" the unsinkable "" molly brown , danny nucci as jack 's friend fabrizio de rossi , eric braeden as john jacob astor , and even bernard fox as colonel archibald gracie .
nice to see dr .
bombay getting work .
also scattered about are some of the other steerage passengers who are basically in the movie so you can feel sorry for them when they die .
this by itself may have been largely compulsory in a film about the titanic , but it transcends this status by putting these characters in direct conflict with the ship 's crewmembers who strive to maintain order and assure that the first - class passengers are placed aboard the lifeboats before anyone else .
in this way , titanic possesses a depth not usually found in action pictures .
you do n't just get a love story with a tragedy as a backdrop , but a very real account of class struggle as well .
as i mentioned before , the budget for this film was tremendous , and it certainly showed in the set dressing and special effects .
the interiors of the titanic are nearly breathtaking with their elaborate trimmings and intricate detail , and one has very little doubt that the layouts are authentic .
with regard to the exteriors , i would dare anyone to point out a film in which a vessel has been recreated with such meticulousness or on such a scale .
cameron actually built a scale model of the titanic in a water tank , but only had room for 90 % , and therefore had to computer - generate the remaining 40 feet .
could 've fooled me and everyone else in the theater , as the splicing is seamless .
also of note in this film is the way the audience is presented with the anatomy of the disaster right at the beginning .
we are told of where the iceberg struck the ship , how the flooding occurred , the way the ship sank , and why it did so in that manner .
these technical details serve as a guide for later on when the action starts happening , and allow us to view the sinking with informed analytic detraction , in addition to the more conventional placement in the midst of mayhem and confusion .
in all , james cameron 's titanic is a good blend of love story , history , and action .
the fact that the film runs longer than most at about three hours is almost unnoticed as the viewer 's attention is held alternately by those three main elements , from the movie 's intriguing beginning to it 's satisfactory ending .
in box office receipts , titanic the movie will undoubtedly live up to the unsinkable expectations of titanic the ship .",1,"['a well - paced , well - designed , and overall well - made movie', 'slips comfortably into his role and plays it well', 'cast well', 'proves herself a good actress , delivering her lines convincingly , and the quality of performances', 'the splicing is seamless', 'it certainly showed in the set dressing and special effects . the interiors of the titanic are nearly breathtaking with their elaborate trimmings and intricate detail , and one has very little doubt that the layouts are authentic', 'marvelous', 'solid performances by the leads and good direction by cameron , a good movie comes through', 'i was pleasantly surprised by this film', 'makes the relationship believable', 'possesses a depth not usually found in action pictures', 'a good blend', 'with the confidence usually found in older actors', 'recreated with such meticulousness or on such a scale', ""the best i 've seen"", ""from the movie 's intriguing beginning to it 's satisfactory ending"", 'will undoubtedly live up to the unsinkable expectations', 'otherwise great acting']"

""
simply irresistible "" is actually quite easy to deny , a disaster of culinary and other proportions pretty much from the opening on .
gellar 's amanda finds herself falling for harried henri bendel exec tom ( sean patrick flannery of powder ) around the same time she discovers an uncanny ability to mystically manifest emotions in her cooking , a secret ingredient that arouses both his interest in her and the public 's in her tiny tribeca eatery .
all this love and sorcery have a lot to do with the telekinetic crab that also figures into the story , a tale that at times plays like an american spin on 1993 's mexican classic "" like water for chocolate .
""
several differences : one , "" like water "" did n't have a telekinetic crab , and two , "" like water "" was a good film .
""
simply irresistible , "" on the other hand , is about as challenging as an easy - bake oven .
amateurishly staged scenes cancel each other out in their badness , from an embarrassing seduction in a literal vanilla fog to an impromptu dance sequence where tom and amanda do their best fred and ginger - though fred and ginger never took part in anything this garish .
the intrusive musical score distracts from the flat dialogue at regular intervals , but
it 's not like you 're were going to miss much .
in fact , take away the few instances of salty language and this has made - for - disney channel written all over it .
but a majority of "" simply irresistible "" 's resistibility factor has less to do with the afore - mentioned overkill
than the bland leads
- tom and amanda are so thin and ambiguously defined that there 's just no fun rooting for their inevitable "" happily ever after .
""
nor do the otherworldly powers that serve to bring them together make sense , so we 're left with a ho - hum relationship based on enchanted eclairs ; it 's not going to last long , people .
perhaps sensing this , the filmmakers have piled on weird supporting characters for acting vets like betty buckley , dylan baker and patricia clarkson , but they do n't go anywhere either .
in fact , nothing in "" simply irresistible "" goes anywhere save for gellar , and she does n't go somewhere so much as you wish she 'd go
_ somewhere _ - like to a better movie .
already proving major talent with relatively few big- and small - screen roles , she 's the sole reason

it seems that the issue of death may not be so different , at least envisioned here in this film .

"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . be forewarned .
during the three years since the release of the groundbreaking success pulp fiction , the cinematic output from its creator , quentin tarantino , has been surprisingly low .
oh , he 's been busy -- doing the talk show circuit , taking small roles in various films , overseeing the production of his screenplay from dusk till dawn , making cameo appearances on television shows , providing a vignette for the ill - fated anthology four rooms -- everything , it seems , except direct another feature - length film .
it 's been the long intermission between projects as well as the dizzying peak which pulp fiction reached which has made mr .
tarantino 's new feature film , jackie brown , one of the most anticipated films of the year , and his third feature film cements his reputation as the single most important new american filmmaker to emerge from the 1990s .
things are n't going well for jackie brown ( pam grier ) .
she 's 44 years old , stuck at a dead - end job ( "" $ 16 , 000 a year , plus retirement benefits that are n't worth a damn "" ) as a flight attendant for the worst airline in north america -- and she 's just been caught at the airport by atf agent ray nicolette ( portrayed with terrific childlike enthusiasm by michael keaton ) and police officer mark dargus ( michael bowen ) smuggling $ 50 000 from mexico for gun - runner ordell robbie ( samuel l . jackson ) , who has her bailed out by unassuming bail bondsman max cherry ( robert forster ) .
the loquacious ordell , based out of a hermosa beach house where his horny , bong - hitting surfer girl melanie ( bridget fonda ) and agreeable crony louis gara ( robert de niro ) hang out , operates under the policy that the best rat is a dead rat , and he 's soon out to silence jackie brown .
meanwhile , the authorities ' target is ordell , and they want jackie to help them by arranging a sting to the tune of a half - million dollars .
only through a series of clever twists , turns , and double - crosses will jackie be able to gain the upper hand on both of her nemeses .
although jackie brown marks mr .
tarantino 's first produced screenplay adaptation ( based on the elmore leonard novel "" rum punch "" )
, there 's no mistaking his distinctive fingerprints all over this film .
while he 's adhered closely to the source material in a narrative sense , the setting has been relocated to los angeles and the lead character 's now black .
in terms of ambiance , the film harkens back to the 1970s , from the wall - to - wall funk and soul music drowning the soundtrack to the nondescript look of the sets -- even the opening title credit sequence has the echo of vintage 1970s productions .
the opening sequence featuring ms .
grier wordlessly striding through the lax , funky music blaring away on the speakers , is emblematic of films of that era .
the timeframe for the film is in fact 1995 , but the atmosphere of jackie brown is decidedly retro .
of course , nothing in the film screams 1970s more than the casting of pam grier and robert forster as the two leads , and although the caper intrigue is fun to watch as the plot twists , backstabbing , and deceptions deliciously unfold , the strength of jackie brown is the quiet , understated relationship developed between jackie and max ; when they kiss , it 's perhaps the most tender scene of the year .
tenderness ?
in a quentin tarantino film ?
sure , there 've been moments of sweetness in his prior films -- the affectionate exchanges between the bruce willis and maria de madeiros characters in pulp fiction and the unflagging dedication shared by the characters of tim roth and amanda plummer , or even in reservoir dogs , where a deep , unspoken bond develops between the harvey keitel and tim roth characters -- but for the most part , mr .
tarantino 's films are typified by manic energy , unexpected outbursts of violence , and clever , often wordy , banter .
these staples of his work are all present in jackie brown , but what 's new here is a different facet of his storytelling -- a willingness to imbue the film with a poignant emotional undercurrent , and a patience to draw out several scenes with great deliberation .
this effective demonstration of range prohibits the pigeonholing of mr .
tarantino as simply a helmer of slick , hip crime dramas with fast - talking lowlifes , and heralds him as a bonafide multifaceted talent ; he 's the real deal .
this new aspect of mr .
tarantino 's storytelling is probably best embodied in a single character -- that of the world - weary , sensitive , and exceedingly - professional max cherry , whose unspoken attraction to jackie is touching .
mr .
forster 's nuanced , understated performance is the best in the film ; he creates an amiable character of such poignancy that when he gazes at jackie , we smile along with him .
much press has been given about the casting of blaxploitation - era icon pam grier in the lead , with the wags buzzing that mr .
tarantino may do for her
what his pulp fiction did to bolster john travolta 's then - sagging career .
as it turns out , ms .
grier is solid in the film 's title role , although nothing here forces her to test her range .
i do have to take exception to the claim that this film marks her career resurrection , though -- she 's been working steadily over the years , often in direct - to - video action flicks , but also in such recent theatrical releases as tim burton 's mars attacks !
and larry cohen 's original gangstas ( where she first teamed up with mr . forster .
)
of course , it 's true that her role here was a godsend -- a meaty a part as this is rarity for * any * actress , let alone one of her age and current status in the industry .
while jackie brown may disappoint those looking for another pulp fiction clone , it marks tremendous growth of mr .
tarantino as a director whose horizons are rapidly expanding , and whose characterizations have never been better .
and while the film 's narrative does n't really warrant a running time of 155 minutes , it 's filled with such sumptuous riches , ranging from the brashness of the vivid soundtrack to entertaining , inconsequential conversations between the characters , that there was n't an unengaging moment .
with an impressive trio of feature films under his belt , it 'll be interesting to see what he tries next .",1,"[""it 's filled with such sumptuous riches"", ""a bonafide multifaceted talent ; he 's the real deal"", ""is solid in the film 's title role"", 'fun to watch', 'effective demonstration of range', 'cements his reputation as the single most important new american filmmaker', 'clever , often wordy , banter', 'his distinctive fingerprints', 'nuanced , understated performance is the best in the film', 'whose horizons are rapidly expanding , and whose characterizations have never been better', 'a patience to draw out several scenes with great deliberation', ""there was n't an unengaging moment"", 'the vivid soundtrack to entertaining , inconsequential conversations', 'marks tremendous growth']"
"plot : a separated , glamorous , hollywood couple must pretend to reunite for a press junket of the last movie that they ever shot together .

now
i only wish that i could pretend never to have seen this movie . . .
critique : trite , unfunny , boring and a waste of everyone 's talent .
how a premise with such zest and bite can turn into a movie that does n't feature any chemistry , any real laughs , any surprises or any spice is beyond me .
how julia roberts is used solely as a "" puppy dog "" character , puttering around in the background while we endure the complete bitchiness of zeta - jones ' character , who is not one bit funny or romantic
( two ideal ingredients in a "" romantic comedy "" ) , is also beyond me .
and why they chose john cusack , a great , quirky actor in his own right , to play
the most bland , uninteresting and unfetching character ( with zero chemistry with either of his leads ) is further more , beyond me .
and to anybody who decided that this project was "" funny "" enough to greenlight featuring the talents mentioned above , along with billy crystal , christopher walker , seth green and stanley tucci .
. .
well , what can i say .
. .
i just do n't have the words .
so is this the worst movie that i 've seen all year ?
no .
but it definitely sucks
and it 's basically because . . .
well , it 's just not funny .
and for the record , allow me to state a few more problems with it .
it starts off slow , it 's got no energy , it does n't engage you with any of its characters
( julia barely gets somewhat interesting in the film , everyone else . . .
lame ! ) , it utilizes way too many flashbacks to move the story forward , it 's utterly predictable , standard , routine , see - through and uninteresting as a plot and it just sits there on the screen , big and ugly , waiting . . .
waiting for you to laugh or find something in it that is amusing .
and then hank azaria shows up . . .
aaaaaah , the film 's savior ( mind you , some might be offended by his exaggeration of a stereotype , but that 's another story altogether ) .
but when an experienced "" voice "" actor upstages all of the main stars in a summer "" blockbuster "" romantic comedy with an over - the - top antonio banderas accent , damn dude . . .
your film 's in trouble ! ! rent this movie on video just to see what went wrong yourself .
the references to ricky ricardo and senor wences
( huh ! ? ) , the idio - plot points like when one of the characters goes on the roof to stretch his arms out and relax , but everyone believes that he 's going to kill himself ( hardy - har - har ) and the cheap way of getting the audience to leave the theater laughing by bringing back a ball - sniffing dog that has no place being in the location at the end of the movie , well .
. .
i could go on .
but i wo n't because i do still respect all of the actors in this film and actually did laugh at azaria , green and tucci 's antics from time to time ( ironic , eh .
. .
what about the leads , dammit ! )
and liked the premise behind the film ( before i saw the finished product , of course ) .
a dud all the way around .
btw , all the talk about this film was that julia roberts was to be in a fat suit for one scene
( her character is supposed to have lost 60 pounds ) , so when the scene finally came , i did get a little excited about what it might look like and then . . .
well , it basically just looked like julia roberts in a fat suit ! ugh .

"it is with some sad irony that i screened fright night part 2 on the day that one of it 's stars , roddy mcdowall passed away at the age of 70 .
mcdowall was one of the most talented and prolific actors in hollywood , having a career that spanned over 60 years and appearing in more than 100 films .
fright night part 2 probably will not be counted among his more memorable roles .
this is really sad considering how good the first fright night film was .
william ragsdale and roddy mcdowall both reprised their roles as the somewhat reluctant vampire killers who seem to be the only ones that realize that vampires walk among us .
( at least in the movies anyway . )
it has been several years since charlie brewster ( ragsdale ) and b - movie actor turned late night horror film host , peter vincent ( mcdowall ) came face to face with a real live vampire who just happened to be charlie 's next door neighbor .
charlie and peter won that battle , but apparently even vampires have relatives who get pissed if you kill members of their family .
apparently charlie 's former bloodsucking next door neighbor had a sister who was none too pleased to find out that some kid and an aging actor staked her sibling .
so she decides to exact a little bit of revenge .
this ends up forcing charlie and peter to battle the forces of darkness yet again .
one of the things that made fright night such a success was chris sarandon who played charlie 's stylish next door neighbor with a taste for blood .
fright night part 2 tries to duplicate that modern style but
it falls sort . while they are stylish , the vamps in this film just do n't have the personality of the undead in the first film .
with the exception of a werewolf who adds some much needed comic relief to a few of the scenes .
one bright spot , speaking from a strictly sexist point of view , is traci lin , who plays charlie 's very skeptical girlfriend .
it 's really a shame that her career has n't been better since she made this film .
ragsdale does a fair job in this film , but does n't give nearly the performance that he did in the original .
roddy mcdowall makes the most with what he is given , which unfortunately is n't much which is a shame because his character was a lot of fun in the original movie .
i guess i would have to say that the first film was a superior product in every way .
the original always left you feeling danger was lurking right around the corner , part 2 had more of the feel of a music video .
never a good thing for a horror film .
another minus
for part 2 was the traditional scenes that leave the audience on the edge of their seats waiting for something to jump out of a shadow where very rare .
for that matter , they were almost nonexistent .
if i was going to watch a horror film , this would be far from my first choice .
the first fright night , on the other hand , would be right up near the top of my list .
if i was in the mood for a roddy mcdowall film i 'd probably head to the science fiction section of my local video store and rent planet of the apes .
either way fright night part 2 would most likely not enter into the equation .",0,"[""does n't give nearly the performance"", 'never a good thing', 'another minus', 'it falls sort', ""just do n't have the personality"", 'this would be far from my first choice']"
"is evil dead ii a bad movie ?
it 's full of terrible acting , pointless violence , and plot holes
yet it remains a cult classic nearly fifteen years after its release .
explaining why this movie stands out from others with similar plots ( including the original evil dead ) is extremely difficult .
` well what 's it about ? '
` five people stranded in a log cabin in the middle of nowhere struggling to survive vicious attacks from a variety of ugly , hairy , wart covered monsters . '
` come on i saw a movie just like that on monster vision last week .
why should i see it again ? '
` no evil dead ii is different , it 's funny . '
` it 's funny to see people die ?
are you sick or something ? '
maybe i am and maybe director sam raimi is as well to create such an enigma of a movie .
his unique execution is as sarcastic as subtle , as disturbing as it is hilarious .
an example of raimi 's odd approach : a monster ( formerly protagonist ash 's girlfriend of all people ) is cut in half by a chainsaw and a tidal wave of blood comes from the open wound .
sure it 's over - the - top , but it is so over - the - top that it is laugh out loud funny ; just try watching ash with a straight face as he unexpectedly is showered with ten gallons of blood , staining his face and knocking him back a few feet .
the whole movie is like this , watch ash get beat up , watch ash defeat the monster , watch ash get beat up again by another even zanier monster .
the more repetitive and unrealistic the movie gets , the more amusing it becomes .
no matter how sick it may sound , it is funny to watch
bruce ampbell 's ash get his butt kicked every five minutes .
and raimi takes advantage , he has ash tormented by the head of his girlfriend , by the body of an old lady , even by his own right hand .
like the less superior idle hands , we watch ash uncontrollably hit himself over and over again until he is forced to cut off his own body part .
but it does n't end , ash now has to fight his severed hand which now moves with the same celerity as thing from the addams family .
all of these events , thrown at you from minute one with roller coaster- like camera movements , at first become shocking , then inexplicably funny .
raimi expects the audience to laugh and as the film progresses , he seems to be enjoying himself even more by borrowing the classic mirror scene from the marx brothers ' duck soup , then bringing more characters into the picture to comically kill them off .
with a running time of less than an hour and a half , raimi gets away with the impossible , making a horror film with more gore than plot and intentionally more laughs than scares . ending evil dead ii with an opening for the third film in the series , raimi obviously had a lot of fun making this movie and could n't wait to make it 's sequel .",1,"['it is funny to watch', 'this movie stands out', 'the more amusing it becomes']"
"i did n't hate the big hit , even though
it is a stupefyingly terrible film .
for the entirety of its running time , my eyes were attached to the screen , and i never once got bored .
i found the film interesting because of its unique awfulness : this is such a confused disaster of a film that it 's entertaining to watch it in the same way that it 's entertaining to witness a thirty car pileup on a freeway spaghetti bowl .
as a narrative , the big hit is pure garbage , never truly deciding its genre and constantly crossing all kinds of boundaries .
it reminded me a lot of grosse pointe blank , which is a similar film that fails in a lot of the same ways .
it 's fine to mix genres , if the film makers know what they 're doing .
unfortunately , writer ben ramsey and director kirk wong do n't seem to know how to handle the material , and the result is an action film that wants to be a comedy .
the biggest problem with the amalgamation , in this case , is that the film is absurd and the comedy is out of place .
but it sure is a fascinating failure .
marky .
. .
er , mark wahlberg stars as melvin surley , a hitman .
he 's a good hitman , apparently , although his tactics seem a bit rambunctious ( he does n't snipe or make clean kills -- he just kicks the door down and shoots everything ) .
he works with a few other hitmen -- cisco ( lou diamond phillips ) , crunch ( bokeem woodbine ) , and vinnie ( antonio sabbato , jr . ) .
they 're a nice bunch of muscular guys , who stand around in the locker room after working out and compare masturbation to sex .
they all work for a man named paris ( avery brooks ) , who is rich , powerful , and in constant need of four sloppy hitmen .
it is very important that they never go beyond their boss and do work on their own ; this , of course , is where the plot comes in .
they decide to kidnap a young japanese girl named keiko ( china chow ) , who has a rich father .
when they do this , it turns out she is paris ' . . .
goddaughter !
it 's very bad to have paris against you .
the story is standard action film stuff .
it 's nothing new , and nothing particularly offensive ( but certainly not the slightest bit compelling ) .
clearly the major selling point of the big hit is that it 's a john woo - type of action film mixed in with some really hip comedy .
it 's true that a lot of the action sequences resemble recent films that go for the same idea ( such as face / off and the replacement killers , which are both far superior ) .
there are stunts that are fun to watch : the opening sequence has melvin and two of his partners going in to kill some guy who has nothing to do with the story .
they use night vision goggles and really powerful handguns .
melvin is also very good at breakdancing , and uses this talent to avoid bullets and knives .
like i said , it 's not boring ; most disasters are n't .
what makes it so bad is its genre - shifting madness .
it seems to start out as a quirky - but - realistic action comedy , as melvin is seen transporting bags of human remains .
then , as soon as they go to their first hit , it turns into a music video with bodies and bullets flying everywhere .
then , somewhere in between , it turns back into comedy .
keiko turns out to be a spunky little girl ; in one amusing scene , she is forced to read a letter out loud , indicating that she has been kidnapped , but the letter is littered with grammatical errors that skew the meaning of the words . and scenes like this work alone , but wong applies this goofy tone to scenes that should be more serious , or not be in the film at all .
one of the most irritating moments has paris ordering cisco to come up to his office after he learns that keiko has been kidnapped ; when cisco gets there , paris and his men are standing around as if they knew cisco did it , but they let him out of there , telling him to find the perpetrator .
the scene is played for laughs , but it is n't funny .
and since it does n't quite work as a comedy , it tries to fall back on the action , which also fails .
this is a film where people fly fifteen feet backwards when shot with a handgun .
cars land on tree branches and are supported by them .
characters betray each other without a second thought .
grenades are thrown in tight places .
people jump out of tall buildings and survive .
people outrun tumbling cars , and get out of the way of falling objects in small fractions of seconds .
most frustrating of all , though , is the film 's definition of a hit man : these guys are anything but subtle , quiet , and skilled individuals .
they 're more like socially depraved militia men ( melvin has an extensive collection of firearms in his garage , including missile launchers and hand - held machineguns ) .
the characters each have one trait that distinguishes them from the rest ; this obviously does n't make for deep or interesting people to watch .
the acting is kind of fun , though -- wahlberg is a good actor , and his innocuous presence in this film is charming in a silly sort of way .
phillips certainly has fun with his psychotic character , while christina applegate , who plays melvin 's fianc ?
e , is convincingly air - headed .
the big hit is an action film that unknowingly spoofs itself in trying to be funny .
the funniest parts are supplied by the actors , and not by the numerous failed attempts at sight gags and one - liners .
it 's a true disaster , one that makes me believe that the goofy and unrealistic tone is completely unintentional .
despite all this , though , i must reiterate the entertainment value here .
you can cherish the awfulness of a film like this . if you embrace the big hit for the catastrophe
that it is , you just might enjoy yourself .",0,"['what makes it so bad', 'most frustrating of all', 'catastrophe', 'a fascinating failure', ""it is n't funny"", 'pure garbage', ""it 's a true disaster"", 'it is a stupefyingly terrible film', 'also fails', 'not the slightest bit compelling', 'this is such a confused disaster of a film', 'one of the most irritating moments']"
"i think that any competent member of the human race who 's ever seen a movie -- any movie -- could probably predict just about every turn in the wedding singer .
even though i try very hard to not predict films as i 'm watching them ( especially not romantic comedies ) , the plot of this particular film just advanced before me seconds , and sometimes minutes , before i actually saw it happen on screen .
but i do n't care .
not even a little .
my reasons for this are simple : 1 ) adam sandler is great .
2 ) drew barrymore is great .
3 ) the movie is so funny .
there are parts that left me gasping for air because i was laughing so hard
.
i have n't laughed this hard in a movie since austin powers .
sandler plays robby hart , a wedding singer who once had dreams of being in a rock band and writing his own music .
in the opening scenes , he seems like a happy - go - lucky wedding singer , at least partially enjoying his profession and doing a rather good job of talking down a really drunk individual ( steve buscemi ) who decides that his brother 's wedding is a good place to tell the whole world that his life , up to that point , was utter pointlessness .
a week later , at his own wedding , he is left standing at the altar by his ex - fianc ?
e , linda ( angela featherstone ) .
with his life in complete disarray , he meets julia ( barrymore ) , a waitress .
she is engaged to glenn ( matthew glave ) , and is to marry him in about three months .
julia and robby become good friends when she enlists him to help with the wedding plans .
soon ( and predictably ) it becomes pretty clear that glenn is a jerk , and that robby and julia really love each other .
oh sure , it 's trite .
and if anyone making this film expected us to , like , feel suspense or something while watching the wedding singer , then they truly underestimated their audience .
what makes the story bearable , aside from the terrific costumes and 80s music , are the performances .
barrymore is simply adorable here
( i 've never seen her look so close to the way she did in et ) .
not only is she pleasant to look at , but her acting job here really is a good one -- and it does n't hurt that the character is likable and adequately well - written .
and the jerk , played in full - force by graves , is just as despicable as any villain in any romantic comedy i 've ever seen .
naturally , the true star here is sandler .
i think the guy is flat - out hilarious .
he can say something that just is n't funny , and his delivery makes me laugh
.
his comedic performance here equals that of happy gilmore , but in this film he goes much further and proves to me that he can , indeed , hold his own as a leading man in a romantic comedy .
whereas his roles in his previous films kind of had sandler playing sandler , the wedding singer gives him a character that , for the first time , he actually has to fit into . as far as i 'm concerned he succeeded , and this film is testimony that he does , in fact ,
have some range in his talents .
and
the movie is just so funny .
perhaps the best moment is when he sings a song for julia that he claims is a little uneven because he began writing it while in a good mood and finished it after his fianc ?
e abandoned him .
this is the part that literally had me groping for a breath of air .
and while the film , like all romantic comedies , takes a hiatus from laughs towards the end because the plot has to finish up , there are more than enough truly hilarious moments in the first hour that make up for any slumps in progress during the second half .
my formal complaints for the wedding singer are n't very important .
the film is predicable , but who cares ?
the characters are extremely likable , the movie is ridiculously funny , and
the experience is simply enjoyable .
in addition to this , i ca n't imagine anyone seeing the preview and not wanting to see the film .
in that order , i conclude that it is pointless for me to even have written this review .
i just want everyone to know that i laughed .
a lot .",1,"['his delivery makes me laugh', 'true star', 'the movie is just so funny', 'flat - out hilarious', 'i laughed . a lot', 'great', 'the terrific costumes', 'have some range in his talents', 'hold his own as a leading man', 'the experience is simply enjoyable', 'i was laughing so hard', 'great', 'her acting job here really is a good one', 'is simply adorable', 'ridiculously funny', 'extremely likable', 'is so funny']"

the 44 caliber killer has struck again .
"" starring john leguizamo , mira sorvino , adrian brody , jennifer esposito , michael rispoli , bebe neuwirth .
rated r .
summer of sam will be remembered as a waste of spike lee 's abilities .
lee is a great filmmaker , often exhibiting kinetic visual flair on par with brian depalma and martin scorsese and a storytelling ability comparable to steven spielberg .
but here , he gets himself into a bind .
his latest effort is a case of a director pretending he has something to say when in reality there is little of substance to absorb from his work .
the summer of 1977 was an unusual summer in new york city .
it was the hottest summer on record .
to boot , new york 's first serial killer was on the loose : calling himself the son of sam ,
david berkowitz killed 9 people in the new york area and frightened the whole city population .
so it was understandable that when nyc was hit with a citywide blackout , people went berserk , causing billions of dollars in damage to the city .
the movie 's focus is on a group of twenty - somethings during that fateful summer : vinny ( john leguizamo ) , a club - hopping , adultrous hairdresser , his benevolent wife dionna ( mira sorvino , looking young ) , ritchie ( adrian brody ) , a punk who becomes an outcast as well as a son of sam suspect , a gang of small time mobsters and a few more minor characters .
we follow them through their roller coaster lives , thrown out of whack even more by the recent killings .
vinny and dionna have marital problems because vinny cheats and dionna tries to please him , make him stay faithful to her .
ritchie gets shunned by his group of friends because he has started to become more and more "" eccentric , "" and has degenerated to the point of dancing in gay night clubs and making porno films with his girlfriend .
tensions build and conflicts arise as the anniversary night of son of sam 's first murder looms ; the night he promises he will strike again .
a local gang with too much time on its hands makes a list detailing all of the people that its members think might be suspects .
at the top of the list is ritchie .
vinny , an unwilling part of the said group , is called upon to set a trap for his friend .
as we watch these proceedings , some of which are painfully graphic ,
the dreaded "" so what ?
"" question springs to mind .
from the way this movie is made , i 'd have guessed that spike lee was trying to tell us something , but as i searched deeper it became clear that there is very little there to find
.
lee touches on so much -- the media , the 70 's punk scene , the details of the actual killings , as well as the characters ' very personal dilemmas -- but
he does n't bring all of his topics together to form a coherent theme or make a discernible statement .
all is not lost if a movie turns out to be hollow ; it can be a saving grace for the film to be enjoyable .
too bad summer of sam does n't get any help here .
frankly , it 's a bore , a redundant and repetitive two hour and twenty minute film that does n't entertain beyond its first half hour .
there is no suspense because the film refuses to be fully about the murders and little involving drama because the film is too muddled and its focus too vague .
leguizamo 's turn as vinnie is annoying and whiny .
the script makes it clear that we 're supposed to believe that his character is flawed , but still a good guy .
you 'd never guess from his performance .
adrian brody and especially mira sorvino fare better .
sorvino gives a riveting , touching performance in a banal movie
( i 'm tempted to think that i liked her because nearly everything else around her was inane ) ; her character is affecting and her emotions true - to - heart .
brody , too paints an effective portrait of a young guy desperate for attention who gets a little more than he bargained for .
summer of sam has some superficial elements of a good film : it looks great , it has a few notable performances and i suppose it 's pretty well directed , in a purely technical way .
but it 's also empty , pretentious and boring .
like last year 's the thin red line , it 's a movie by a director who does n't know what he wants to say but goes ahead and says it anyway . ?

naturally , this is the setup for the other event horizon . . .
the movie .
when the ship suddenly appears at the point that it vanished at , just outside of neptune , the crew of the ship called the "" lewis and clark "" has to go to investigate , and dr .
william weir , the creator of the "" event horizon , "" gets to come along for the ride .
if you 've glanced at a poster for this movie , you know that , supposedly , what follows is "" infinite terror .
""
well , i do n't know about the "" terror "" part , but
"" infinite "" certainly seems to qualify . . .
event horizon is a mean - spirited , gory , sick excuse for a film .
it starts off as an alien rip - off , and then degenerates into a pointlessly bloody slasher flick after about 40 minutes .
at least for those first 40 minutes it 's an * interesting * rip - off of alien .
that 's a lot more than can be said for the rest of them movie , which seems to go on forever
.
it not a scary monster movie , nor is it a psychological thriller .
it is simply a movie which tries again and again to make the viewers feel sick to their stomach at the site of extreme gore .
you 've seen this kind of movie before .
the hellraiser series had plenty of scenes containing this sensibility .
this is a kind of movie for which i have no respect , a kind of movie which i had hoped died out years ago .
it is quite possible for a movie to frighten or shock its audience without resorting to nothing more than gore , but event horizon takes the low road , and the viewers pay the price .
there are many good , respectable performances , from fishburne and neill most noticably .
paul anderson 's direction is impressive , as it was in mortal kombat .
there are many nice special effects , mostly dealing with numerous common objects floating around in zero - gravity .
the sets are beautiful to gaze upon .
and richard t .
jones ' character ( cooper ) is hilarious and extremely likable ( more so than most characters i 've seen in recent movies ) for the little screen time that he has .
and none of this can save the movie from being a d - grade level of film .
the idea of a ship that has some sort of life within its walls , a life that knows the fears and inner skeletons of the human passengers , is a promising one .
a haunted house story in space is n't such a bad idea .
but the final execution is extremely disappointing .
that 's not to say that philip eisner ( here making his feature film - writing debut ) does n't have talent .
for those first 40 minutes , he manages to make a tired premise interesting , adding in aspects of unique flavor into a rip - off story , and that 's something that not too many writers can do .
he even has one scene that , though it also tries to sicken the audience , has a honestly tense feel to it ( the scene in question deals with one of the crew being in an airlock while others try to save him from floating into space ) .
he definitely has something of a gift , but it 's not fully on display here .
i certainly will look forward to seeing more from him , and i hope that his future work fully explores his talent and the story possibilities of the premise .
but because of what this movie degenerates into , i have little or no respect , and got little or no enjoyment , out of it .
if this is what we have to look forward to in the future of film , then i agree with laurence fishburne 's sentiment - "" god help us .

""" mandingo "" has traditionally been seen as one of two things : either a much - needed revisionist look at slavery in the south , or in the words of film critic leonard maltin , "" a trashy potboiler "" that "" appeals only to the s&m crowd .
""
actually , i think "" mandingo "" is a strange combination of the two , although
it fails on both fronts .
it 's too trashy to be good drama , but too dramatic to be good trash .
the story takes place on a dilapidated louisiana plantation run by crotchety old warren maxwell ( james mason ) and his son , hammond ( perry king ) .
one day in new orleans , hammond comes across a slave trader selling a mandingo named mede ( heavyweight boxer ken norton ) .
although the movie never explains it , a mandingo is simply the name for africans who come from the region of the upper niger river valley .
according to the movie , mandingos were the rolls royce of african slaves .
hammond pays top price for mede and has to fight off others in order to get him .
hammond then spends his time training mede to be a fighter in money brawls with other slaves .
meanwhile , hammond has married his cousin , blanche ( susan george ) , because she wants to escape her family and he is under pressure from his father to produce a grandchild .
hammond , however , is happier spending nights with his "" bed wench , "" the derogatory name given to female slaves used by their masters for easy sex .
it is quickly apparent that hammond , despite his overt racism , is more in love with his bed wench , a sensitive slave girl named ellen ( brenda sykes ) , than he is with blanche .
hammond considers blanche tainted goods because he finds out on their wedding night that another man had "" pleasured "" her before he did .
of course , it 's fine that he 's slept with numerous slave girls , but the fact that his wife , a "" white lady , "" had been with another man out of wedlock destroys his capacity to care for her .
so blanche is usually left lonely and sex - starved while hammond is sleeping with ellen .
blanche gets back at hammond by seducing the studly mede and bearing his child .
hammond and his father can not stand the idea that blanche has given birth to a half - black child ( although it 's okay that ellen was pregnant by hammond ) , so warren kills the child by letting it bleed to death after birth , and hammond poisons blanche .
hammond then finds mede , shoots him twice in the shoulder , and pushes him into a giant cauldron of boiling water .
yes , you read right : the film ends with hammond getting his revenge by boiling mede alive .
judging only by the plot , "" mandingo "" is pure sexploitation .
the main purpose of the film seems to be getting as many blacks and whites into bed together as possible , with only the slightest commentary on what that would mean in 19th century southern society .
when "" mandingo "" was released in 1975 , it was still a bit of a shocker to see miscegenation on screen in such a graphic detail ; this way the movie could revise cinematic history while attracting large audiences of curious voyeurs .
dramatically , "" mandingo "" is weak and unfocused , and historically it 's mostly confused .
if one were to judge history by this film , it would be easy to walk away with the notion that the entire system of american slavery was based on sexuality , not economics .
not once in the film do we see any of the slaves working , except for a few house servants .
the men spend most of the time sitting around , while the sole purpose of a female slave seems to be free sex for the owner .
there is historical basis in the notion that slave owners often slept with their female slaves , but "" mandingo 's "" overwhelming emphasis on this aspect of slavery gives the movie the unpleasant taste of a cheap sex flick ( although there 's plenty of violence -- fights , vicious beatings , shootings , and the aforementioned human boiling sequence -- thrown in for good measure ) .
some tried to write off "" mandingo "" as a blaxploitation film , one of a number of quickly - made , low - budget films appealing to black sensibilities in the early seventies , but it 's not that easy .
"" mandingo "" was studio - financed by paramount pictures , and produced by dino de laurentiis , the grandiose italian producer behind such notorious productions as "" the bible "" ( 1966 ) , the remake of "" king kong "" ( 1976 ) , and the ill - fated "" dune "" ( 1984 ) .
the director was richard fleischer , a veteran who was best known for several special effects - laden action movies including "" 20 , 000 leagues under the sea "" ( 1954 ) and "" fantastic voyage "" ( 1966 ) , as well as such superior suspense films as "" the narrow margin "" ( 1952 ) .
the script , based on the supermarket best - seller by ken ostott ( and the subsequent play by jack kirkland ) , was penned by norman wexler , who had been nominated for an oscar two years earlier for his work on "" serpico .
"" james mason , perry king , and susan george were well - known and respected actors ( mason already had three oscar nominations under his belt ) , and ken norton appeared to have a promising film career .
so why is "" mandingo "" so bad ?
a number of reasons , including the fact that all those experienced filmmakers behind and in front of the camera did a lousy job .
wexler 's script is pure poor hokum bordering on the offensive
; it combines stereotyped slave - talk ( "" yessuh , massuh "" ) , stereotyped southern white trash talk ( "" fer whut're you gittin ' outta bed ? "" ) , and stereotyped contemporary militant black talk ( "" if you see me hang , you gon na know you killed a black brother ! "" ) .
fleischer 's direction is clumsy , especially during the fight scenes , and all the actors give weak performances , especially susan george whose constant shrieking finally becomes laughable .
nevertheless , credit should be given where credit is due .
despite its exploitative nature , "" mandingo "" was one of the first hollywood movies to take an alternative look at slavery .
until then , there had been a kind of underlying racism in all hollywood films dealing with slavery .
even classics such as "" gone with the wind "" ( 1939 ) can be seen as inherently racist by its glossing over the subject matter .
"" mandingo "" reassessed the south , and showed that it was n't all beautiful plantations , green fields , and pretty sunsets .
but all this is constantly undermined by the film 's negligible point - of - view
-- it claims to see things from the black perspective , but the entire narrative focus is on the soap opera tales of the white owners .
with a little more maturity and different handling , "" mandingo "" might have been an effective , worthwhile film .
while it portrays many sensitive aspects of slavery , it never deals with them .
the issues the movie brings up are worthwhile , but wexler 's script refuses to move them beyond a surface level of trashily vicarious viewing .
there is a great deal of potential in honestly exploring the nature of a sexual relationship between slave and owner , but "" mandingo "" never does it .
steven spielberg touched on that same topic in "" schindler 's list "" ( 1993 ) , by looking at a nazi officer writhing in inner turmoil because of his feelings for a jewish maid .
the difference between that film and "" mandingo "" is that spielberg dealt with the situation in a fair , unexploitive manner that focused on the inherent human dilemma .
"" mandingo "" is satisfied to simply show some skin , and because of that , its "" trashy potboiler "" nature overshadows any potential social good it might have accomplished .",0,"['refuses to move them beyond a surface level of trashily vicarious viewing', ""it fails on both fronts . it 's too trashy to be good drama , but too dramatic to be good trash"", ""weak and unfocused , and historically it 's mostly confused"", ""undermined by the film 's negligible point - of - view"", 'clumsy', 'did a lousy job', 'give weak performances', 'constant shrieking finally becomes laughable', 'pure poor hokum bordering on the offensive']"
"except for a few bright moments of good verbal comedy , that old feeling is embarrassing to sit through .

"this summer , one of the most racially charged novels in john grisham 's series , a time to kill , was made into a major motion picture .
on january 3 of this year , director rob reiner basically re - released the film under the title of ghosts of mississippi .
based on the true story of 1963 civil rights leader medgar evars ' assassination , ghosts of mississippi revolves around the 25-year legal battle faced by myrlie evars ( whoopi goldberg , sister act ) and her quest to have her husband 's obvious assassin and racist byron
de la beckwith ( james woods , casino ) jailed .
so she turns to assistant district attorney and prosecutor bobby delaughter ( alec baldwin , heaven 's prisoners ) to imprison the former kkk member .
ghosts sets its tone with an opening montage of images from african - american history , from slave - ship miseries to life in the racist south of the 1960 's .
but all too soon , the white folks take over , intoning lines like "" what 's america got to do with anything ?
this is mississippi !
"" as beckwith , james woods , with his head larded with latex most of the time as an old man , teeters between portraying evil and its character .
meanwhile , goldberg turns in a very serious and weepy performance as the wife who would n't let her husband 's death rest until she got the conviction .
both deserve serious oscar - consideration .
this brings us to the dull performance of baldwin .
let 's face it , trying to match matthew mcconaughey 's wonderful acting in a time to kill is basically impossible .
and baldwin is living proof of this , as no emotions could be felt .
it seemed as if he actually had to struggle to shed a single tear .
either poor acting or poor directing , but something definitely went wrong .
another strange mishap was the fact that goldberg 's facial features did n't change , as she looked the same in the courtroom as she did holding her husband 's dead body 25-years earlier .
yet woods ' was plastered with enough make up to make him look like goldberg 's father .
at least the make - up was realistic .
with some emotional moments in the poorly written script , ghosts of mississippi lacked in heart , when its predecessor , a time to kill , brought tears to everyone 's eyes .
do n't get me wrong , the movie was n't all that bad , but if you 've seen grisham 's masterpiece , then do n't expect this one to be an excellent film . ,",1,"['both deserve serious oscar - consideration', 'the make - up was realistic']"

"i suppose an argument could be made that toy story is one of those films that did n't need a sequel .
beloved by kids and their parents , respected equally by mainstream america and geekish movie buffs , that first movie remains a landmark of recent history , the one that burst open the possibilities of computer animation and demonstrated through wild invention and giddy chutzpah just how complacent the disney animation machine had become in cranking out fluffy razzle - dazzle entertainment full of formula storytelling and banal songwriting .
if disney was embarrassed at being beaten at its own game ( toy story was a smash hit of unexpected proportions , and one that caught the merchandising end of the business unaware as demand for action figures far outstripped supply ) , it did n't show , and as distributor and part - owner of the property , at least it had a piece of the action .
toy story 2 was greenlighted as a direct - to - video project , disney 's standard tactic for milking a few more bucks out of hot franchises without expending the effort of developing a proper feature film .
as someone who does n't believe sequels are necessarily a bad thing ( granted , they usually are a bad thing , but that 's because they 're made for the wrong reasons ) , i had to wonder what in the world they were thinking .
fortunately , disney claimed to have been so knocked - out by early animation tests that they let pixar go full - speed ahead with a theatrical sequel .
lucky thing , too -- like the first movie ,
this one is a joy to behold on the big screen , and technically , it improves on its predecessor on just about every level .
( from a business standpoint , the end credits show that the new creations are copyrighted by pixar , while the previous film 's elements are shared between pixar and disney , a sign of the production house 's new cachet in hollywood . )
visually , the main shortcoming of this fully computer - generated movie is that human figures are still rendered relatively poorly , making them look a little creepy .
fortunately , that eerie unreality fits in perfectly with the perspective of the movie , where the secret world of toys is more immediate , and arguably more attractive , than the world of the humans who surround them .
as before , the story is predicated on the premise that the toys scattered around the bedroom of a little boy named andy -- and , indeed , all the toys scattered around the bedrooms of all little children -- come to life in the child 's absence .
while the toys scamper about and chatter endlessly among themselves , the real joy of a toy 's life is to mean something to its owner .
one of the subjects of this new film is the sadness of toys that have been broken or abandoned , left on a shelf to gather dust , and another is the sort of emotional limbo inhabited by toys that are mere prizes of covetous collectors .
most often , those toys are packed away in dark spaces , safe from sunlight and humidity , and often they 're not even removed from their packaging .
imagine what a chip that would put on your shoulder , and you 'll understand the attitudes of the collector 's items that show up in this movie .
sheriff woody ( voiced by a note - perfect tom hanks ) , the longtime favorite among andy 's toys who was challenged in the previous go - round by the arrival of flashy - new - thing action figure buzz lightyear ( tim allen ) , suffers an injury early in the film , when andy tugs too hard on his arm and pulls a seam apart , revealing the stuffing inside .
this accident catalyzes some uneasieness among the toys , who know too well that a broken toy is often a forgotten toy , and a forgotten toy is one that loses its reason for existence .
those anxieties are crystallized when andy 's mom tears through his living room , collecting old toys for a yard sale .
and there 's an ironic twist to the tale , as woody winds up being stolen by an avid toy collector who needs exactly that quaint cowboy figure to complete a set that he hopes to sell to a japanese toy museum for a sizable sum .
the rest of andy 's toys , who owe him quite a debt , resolve to rescue him .
that this film manages to turn a box marked "" 25 cents "" into a symbol of doom , or to make its screed against the retention of collectible toys by wrongheaded profiteers fuel for a metaphysical dilemma , is a testament to its skill at metaphor , seamlessly translating the hopes and fears of our real world into that of the toys .
operating on this level of abstraction , toy story 2 tackles some mighty heavy issues without once preaching or veering into pretentiousness .
( the worst i can say is that randy newman seems to have reserved his sappiest lyric in years for sarah mclachlan , who stops the movie cold by singing it at just about the halfway mark . )
sometimes i think toy story 2 tries too hard .
there 's somewhat less of the seat - of - the - pants loopiness that energized the first film , allowing it to surprise and excite on a near - constant basis , and more philosophizing about toys , collectors , the nature of happiness and the meaning of life .
while that leads to fewer bellylaughs , it does make way for more elaborate humor and an uncommonly ambitious reflexivity that asks the toys to consider their own status as commodities that move in and out of fashion .
( just do n't ask why andy 's favorite toy is based on a tv series that was canceled in 1957 . ) where else in mainstream movies do you get such an awesome moment as the one where buzz arrives at al 's toy barn to find it stocked to the gills with his doppelgangers , buzz lightyear action figures ?
forget the self - congratulatory science fiction of the matrix -- this is a fundamental mind - bender for buzz , and the audience shares his humility and wonderment at the sight .
here , as in the roughly concurrent scene where woody watches tapes of the howdy doodyish children 's tv show that originated his character , we see our protagonists come face - to - face with god .
in sly ways , then , toy story 2 can be read as a film about mortality , a metaphorical consideration of aging and death .
significantly , the film 's very first sequence concludes with a grim shocker that had our opening - night crowd in a near - uproar .
and toward the end , when buzz and woody speculate on how long they have before andy grows up and discards his old toys , one of them observes , with an alacrity both inspirational and heartbreaking , that it will be fun while it lasts .
so toy story 2 joins the tradition of children 's stories , largely neglected of late , that say something real about the inevitable joys and tragedies of existence .
what 's really striking is that both toy story films ( and , to a lesser degree , pixar 's a bug 's life ) are kids ' movies with wit and sophistication to shame most of their ostensibly adult counterparts , not to mention whatever piece of tot - friendly eye - candy is due from the disney dream factory any given summer .
it puts one in mind of the glory days of chuck jones and the old gang at warner bros .
animation .
i 'm not sure lasseter and
his pals at pixar will ever operate at quite that level of purely visual invention -- they love traditional narrative too much -- but , boy , it makes me wonder what they might come up with next .

joe is cocky , but also good at heart as he continues to carry out kind deeds for people he does n't even know .
his fellow reporter is the british michael henderson ( stephen dillane ) .
michael is quickly growing tired of the horror that surrounds him and the world 's lack of interest .
henderson is haunted by the memory of an altar boy who witnesses the mother 's death as well as a young girl who he finds orphaned in a hospital after a mortar attack on citizens waiting in line for bread .
he decides to take action when a united nations ' delegation descends upon the area to declare yugoslavia the fourteenth most dangerous place on earth .
henderson begins a series profiling an orphanage located on the front lines .
he finds children of all ages living in fear and taking care of each other with the help of one adult .
during his visits , he befriends a pre - teen girl , emira ( emira nuseric ) who serves as surrogate mother to baby roadrunner .
he promises to get emira out of harm 's way if he gets the chance .
after the un delegation leaves the country without rescuing any of the children , henderson loses hope .
however , his reporting has grabbed the attention of nina ( marisa tomei ) and her children 's aid group that helps to find homes for the yugoslavian orphans .
unfortunately , only babies are wanted for adoption , so henderson pledges to take emira to england .
the group of children , nina and henderson depart the front lines on a dangerous escape for italy .
can they complete this dangerous trek through the war torn countryside and avoid hostile troops gathering up muslims for concentration camps ?
the movie was beautifully and sensitively made .
director michael winterbottom and screenwriter
frank cottrell boyce vividly express the societal destruction that has occurred .
they show the destroyed lives , families that have been split up , and the desolation that everyone attempts to cope with .
this is best exemplified by the group of yugoslavians henderson , his producer and flynn have befriended .
the group of twenty - somethings reside in a bombed out bar without life 's simplest pleasures and amenities .
one of them is an accomplished musician who spends his days playing the piano and promising to play a concert when sarajevo is declared the most dangerous place on earth .
like the rest of those deeply effected by the war , this small group tries to survive instead of trying to live .
winterbottom
brilliantly intersplices scenes with actual news footage to give the film the feel of a documentary and keeps the viewer aware that many of these horrors are being carried out thousands of miles away as you sit safely in your living room .
the picture is also bolstered by beautiful cinematography
that captures the devastation of this city that hosted the 1984 olympics .
winterbottom and boyce also produce a realistic portrayal of the reporters covering the atrocities .
this portrayal is much more flattering to reporters than earlier wafflemovies .
com selection mad city .
we watch them struggle to cover the horror , while trying to remain professionally detached .
however , they are human and question the reason behind it all , why no one cares , and how they can get out .
stephen dillane is wonderful as henderson .
he portrays the character as an everyman caught in the middle of extraordinary events .
dillane avoids making the character overly heroic and preachy .
henderson realizes that he can not save the world , but he can help a few .
it is a wonderful opportunity for dillane after he had to suffer through the denis leary - sandra bullock disaster two if by sea .
woody harrelson continues to prove that he is one of the finest , most versatile actors of his generation .
harrelson plays the cocky celebrity reporter with a heart of gold by allowing the character 's caring nature and vulnerability shine through .
harrelson is equally adept at taking on roles as zany leading men ( cheers , white men ca n't jump ) as well as
excellent supporting roles such as this one .
this ability will serve him well and give him a long , successful career .
america 's involvement in this struggle comes seven years after the events of the movie take place .
for those who do not have a full understanding of the history of the conflict , the entire movie , most importantly the opening scenes , provide a history lesson .
war is a foreign concept to most of us in america .
battles are fought thousands of miles away among people we have no attachment to .
televised images of the gulf war are all the experience most of us have with war .
this picture brings it right into your living room and makes you think outside of our own small world , something we do n't do enough of in 90 's america .",1,"['brilliantly', 'continues to prove that he is one of the finest , most versatile actors of his generation', 'a wonderful opportunity', 'will serve him well', 'beautifully and sensitively made', 'bolstered by beautiful cinematography', 'excellent supporting roles such as this one']"
"one of the contributors to the destruction of the batman film franchise chris o'donnell stars in this remake of buster keaton 's 1925 silent film seven chances .
now i 've never seen seven chances , as i 'm more of a chaplin fan than a keaton fan , but i seriously doubt that the classic version could be as insipid as this .
o'donnell plays jimmie shannon , the manager of a pool table manufacturing company .
he also fears commitment , and despite dating anne ( renee zellweger ) for over three years , he 's unwilling to marry her .
his reasons ?
well he 's a guy you see , and well , guys are like stallions , and they apparently do n't like to be roped or something ( hey , that 's the movie 's explanation . . .
i 'd marry renee zellweger in a second ) .
eventually it comes time for jimmie to propose , and when he does , it 's the most absurd proposal ever uttered by a man ever .
he essentially says to her , "" you win "" and hands her a ring .
the audience should now hate this character .
i did .
then the meat of the plot presents itself .
jimmie 's grandfather ( peter ustinov , completely wasted ) dies and leaves jimmie his entire estate of 100 million dollars as well as ownership of the pool table business .
however , in order to get the money and save the jobs of the factory workers , jimmie must be married before his next birthday ( which is just over 24 hours away ) .
having blown his chances with anne , jimmie proceeds to track down all his prior girlfriends and suggest a "" business proposition "" .
the movie was n't half bad by this time , surprisingly .
it was n't boring me , and even managed to read my thoughts at one point .
ustinov 's character left a video will , and while he 's reading the ridiculous clause in it , i thought to myself "" what is this , brewster 's millions ?
"" . as soon as i thought it , hal holbrook 's character actually says "" what is this , brewster 's millions ?
""
it was quite surreal .
something happens though during the film 's final act that caused me to sharply drop the rating
it was going to receive .
up to that point , all of jimmie 's prior girlfriends had turned down his "" business proposition "" which i felt was good .
at least the film was n't painting women to be cold hearted gold diggers .
when jimmie has no other options , his goofy friend ( played by artie lange , making a career out of playing the goofy friend ) places an ad in the newspaper that somehow becomes a front page story .
at this point , 100 , 000 women don wedding gowns and head off to persuade jimmie to pick them to be his bride .
these women arrive at jimmie 's location and immediately start bullying him about what he 's looking for in a woman .
when he 's had enough of their unjustified attacks , he tells the angry mob that there 's been a mistake and he wo n't be marrying any of them .
as a result , the women proceed to chase him around the city , in hopes of catching him and tearing his limbs off .
this goes on for the rest of the film .
it 's just chris o'donnell running from 100 , 000 obnoxious , greedy , angry and stupid women .
my groans of disgust could be heard for miles .
the film finally ended ( thankfully ) , but to this day
i 'm still groaning .
the bachelor is available on dvd from new line home video .
it contains the film in both full frame and in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 . 85 : 1 , cast and crew info , and special dvd - rom features .
the original theatrical trailer is also on the disc , which contains scenes not in the film .
apparently there was even more footage of the gang of brides chasing o'donnell around the city , and at one point o'donnell is leaping from the tops of buses .
so that was bad enough to be cut , but the other 30 minutes of bride shenanigans was good ? ugh .",0,"['as insipid as this', 'caused me to sharply drop the rating', 'ugh .', ""i 'm still groaning"", 'one of the contributors to the destruction', 'my groans of disgust could be heard for miles']"
"capsule : this is a film that avoids easy answers .
wilhelm furtwangler
, then the world 's greatest orchestra conductor stayed in germany and cooperated with the nazis .
what were his views , was he a war criminal or a secret resistance fighter ?
how much did he know about crimes against humanity ?
the us government investigated him after the war and this film is a dramatization of that investigation .
,
high +2 ( -4 to +4 ) in my opinion one of the best films of the last few years is istvan szabo 's sunshine , a film that covers the fortunes of a jewish hungarian family under the reigns of three different regimes , hungarian aristocrats , nazis , and communists .
szabo 's follow - up film , a german production , is much more limited in scope .
it is about the post - war investigation of who criminally supported the nazis and who opposed them .
ronald harwood 's screenplay ambiguously looks at the investigation of a great classical music conductor who stayed on in germany when the nazis took power and became the most popular conductor of the third reich .
maj .
steve arnold ( played by harvey keitel ) has been assigned by his superiors to investigate wilhelm furtwangler ( stellan skarsgard ) , perhaps europe 's greatest classical music conductor .
when other artists fled germany , furtwangler remained behind and conducted for the hitler and his henchmen .
after the war is over arnold assigned to interview furtwangler and members of his orchestra and if appropriate to prosecute him for war crimes .
he secretly is told by his commanding officer to find furtwangler guilty .
from there we follow him and learn a little about arnold and something about furtwangler and his orchestra .
as he interviews members of the wartime orchestra arnold starts noticing odd peculiarities that may or may not point to a conspiracy against his investigation .
there is a certain sameness to the responses that he is getting .
perhaps any cooperation he is getting
has been in some ways managed .
if so , perhaps he can never come to the truth .
in large part the film is about mind games that arnold uses to manipulate his interviewees and especially furtwangler .
where the script has problems is that in the end it is so ambiguous .
it has no obvious resolution and not much of a final act .
when it is over whether anything has been established is open to interpretation .
perhaps that is better than so many films
that make it all to obvious what the audience should believe , but it is like watching a murder mystery and never finding out who the killer is .
we are given clues to something
but they are never tied up .
in the end we just know more about both arnold and furtwangler .
the film is basically a stage play .
the visual is not very important .
corners are cut visually including touches like filling windows with photographs to avoid having to shoot on location .
as with a stage play , what this film centers on the dialog ,
and that is intriguing .
i rate the film an 8 on the 0 to 10 scale and a high +2 on the -4 to +4 scale .
[ there is one piece of sloppiness few people but me would notice .
at one point we clearly see arnold 's desk calendar say "" jan 16 tues .
""
a quick mental calculation told me that combination could occur in 1945 and then not again until 1951 .
the events had to take place in 1946 or 1947 .
a possible date could be obtained from any world almanac . ]",1,"['that is better than so many films', 'and that is intriguing']"
"in "" magic town "" , jimmy stewart is in peak form playing a pollster who heads to a "" perfect "" town to gauge their reactions on the sorts of issues that only poll - takers care about .
however , as time progresses , and he finds himself falling in love with the town ( and a woman ) , he begins to see that what he 's doing is wrong .
the plot is standard stuff , but that 's not important .
in a film like this , it 's the calibre of the actors that make or break it .
obviously , since stewart stars , that 's practically a non - issue .

"after a stylistic detour with mrs .
parker and the vicious circle ( which , despite its uncomfortable tone , was close to being a conventional movie )
, director alan rudolph has returned to his unique brand of film making with afterglow , a romantic black comedy about love , betrayal , and self - absorption .
while these may not be the most unusual themes to fashion into a motion picture , rudolph 's atypical approach to the characters and their situations makes for an intriguing , if not always pleasant , movie .
it is said that rudolph is a polarizing director ?
meaning that most viewers either love his work or hate it .
until mrs .
parker , i had not been overly impressed by his movies .
i found equinox , his last pre- mrs .
parker effort , to be irritating and frustrating .
i was somewhat surprised , therefore , to discover that i liked afterglow .
there are several reasons for this , but the paramount one is that rudolph seems to have muted some of the most strident , mannered aspects of his approach .
the characters here are more like real people with genuine problems ,
the story is absorbing , and the acting is top - notch . in short , rudolph has created a world that it 's worth spending two hours in .
afterglow introduces us to two unhappily married couples .
jeffrey byron ( jonny lee miller ) is a cold , seemingly - heartless businessman who is sexually indifferent to his young wife , marianne ( lara flynn boyle ) .
for her part , marianne is so obsessed with having a baby that she never attempts to interact with her husband on a human level .
all she 's interested in is seducing him during those few days when she 's ovulating .
after he refuses to make love , she decides to find someone else to play the role of sperm donor .
the other couple , lucky ( nick nolte ) and phyllis mann ( julie christie ) , are an older pair , but they 're no more content than jeffrey and marianne .
a mysterious fracture in their past relationship has driven them apart .
they remain married as a matter of convenience , but , since phyllis wo n't allow lucky to touch her , they have an unspoken agreement whereby he can fool around as much as he wants provided that no lasting bond is established as a result of these affairs .
the landscape of emotional pain between them is palpable .
the four characters begin interacting when marianne hires lucky as a handyman to fix up the inside of the apartment she shares with jeffrey .
the two of them are immediately attracted to one another , and it does n't take long before they 're lounging together , naked , in her pool .
meanwhile , jeffrey , who is captivated by older women , runs into phyllis in a hotel bar , is smitten , and invites her to accompany him on a weekend retreat to the mountains .
the romantic couplings of the characters are interesting in that they illustrate the multiple faces of love .
sex means something different to everyone ?
to jeffrey , it 's an unpleasant chore , a loss of control ;
to marianne , it 's a means to a maternal end ; to lucky , it 's an enjoyable distraction that blocks out his marital troubles ; and to phyllis , it 's a method of establishing or denying emotional closeness .
ultimately , none of these characters appears to love anyone else as much as they love themselves .
the greatest strength of the film lies not in the script , but in the performances .
jonny lee miller is perfect as the selfish , callous , suit - and - tie businessman .
those who recall him as sickboy in trainspotting will find that he is almost unrecognizable here as the image of conformity .
lara flynn boyle , who was n't impressive in rudolph 's equinox , is greatly improved , making marianne a jumble of sexiness and vulnerability .
nick nolte is delightful as the uninhibited lucky , and he manages to deliver some of rudolph 's most pregnant lines with practiced ease . the clear standout , however , is julie christie , who is nothing short of delicious
as the world - weary phyllis .
her often wry , occasionally cutting asides are the source of much of the film 's humor , and there 's hardly ever a moment when she does n't steal the spotlight from her co - stars .
i do n't know if afterglow is the film to convert rudolph- detractors , but it seems that this movie is a little more accessible than some of the director 's earlier productions .
enough of his trademark style remains , however , to reassure his supporters .
afterglow is basically a four - pronged character study .
the plot is not especially compelling , but the character interaction is , and that 's the real reason to see this motion picture .
rudolph has painted an able picture of the non - romantic side of love -- the one that has more to do with tolerance and familiarity than with affection and attraction .",1,"['the story is absorbing', 'nothing short of delicious', 'delightful', 'is greatly improved', 'the acting is top - notch', 'the clear standout', ""manages to deliver some of rudolph 's most pregnant lines with practiced ease"", 'returned to his unique brand', 'is perfect as', 'an intriguing']"
"these days the lack of originality in hollywood reflects itself in the deluge of remakes .
but , only a few years ago , before wes craven publicly made fun of the practice , sequels had been more popular among hollywood producers .
sequels also used to be popular among directors and movie stars whose careers went south .
the way to regain popularity and prestige , they thought , was the use the same formulas , characters and story lines that brought them success in the first place .
one of such celebrity was eddie murphy , black comedian of 1980s whose career was in big decline during the first part of this decade .
in order to return to the spotlight , he chose to resurrect the franchise created by his most popular film , beverly hills cop , 1984 action comedy that had already spawned the sequel in 1987 .
seven years later , for the third instalment , he used the directorial service of john landis , another fading star , with whom he successfully collaborated twice - in trading places and coming to america .
this time , however , third time was n't the charm and beverly hills iii was failure .
eddie murphy had to wait few more years for real comeback .
eddie murphy here plays axel foley , fast - talking streetwise detroit policeman , who raids illegal chop shop .
the routine police action ends in tragedy , when the criminals kill foley 's boss .
determined to bring the killers to justice , foley realises that their leader is ellis de wald ( timothy carhart ) .
when it turns out that de wald happens to be security chief for wonderland theme park in los angeles , foley goes back to los angeles .
there , with the help of his old friend , local policeman rosewood ( judge rheinhold ) , foley would clash with money counterfeit ring .
ten years has passed since the original and times are definitely different .
in this decade , the contrast between blue collar detroit and yuppie beverly hills , which provided a lot of gags in 1984 film , simply does n't work .
screenwriter steven e .
de souza provides another conflict , this time between the childish sillyness of the good guys and business - like professionalism of the bad guys .
since foley belongs to the former , his character had to watch his language , and the tone of the film in general is more infantile .
unfortunately , this film still belongs to action movie genre , and there is too much violence for little children .
nice example is the humorous scene in the beginning , which turns into standard ramboesque bloodbath .
unlike donner with the lethal weapon series , landis simply ca n't balance the comedy with "" regular "" action , and
the result is a film that fails in both aspects .
action scenes are sometimes interesting , but not too spectacular ( at the end , scenery of wonderland is more fascinating than the action itself ) ; humour , on the other hand , falls flat . to make even worse , some minor characters from 1984 film gets unnecessary and sometimes irritating overexposure ( especially art expert turned into arms dealer , played by bronson pinchot ) .
in the end , although the film provided some entertainment , viewers , at least critical ones , would probably be happy to know that there are n't any plans for beverly hills

"the general 's daughter will probably be the cleverest stupid film we 'll see this year -- or perhaps the stupidest clever film .
it 's confusing to a critic when
so much knuckleheaded plotting and ostentatious direction shares the screen with so much snappy dialogue and crisp character interaction .
that , however , is what happens when legendary screenwriter william goldman takes a pass at an otherwise brutally predictable conspiracy thriller .
the punched - up punch lines are ever on the verge of convincing you the general 's daughter has a brain in its head , even as the remaining 75 % of the narrative punches you in the face with its lack of common sense .
our hero is warrant officer paul brenner , a brash investigator for the u . s .
army 's criminal investigation division .
his latest case is the murder of captain elisabeth campbell ( leslie stefanson ) at a georgia base , the victim found tied to the ground after an apparent sexual assault and strangulation .
complicating the case is the fact that capt .
campbell is the daughter of general joe campbell ( james cromwell ) , a war hero and potential vice - presidential nominee .
general campbell wants to keep the case out of the press , which gives brenner only the 36 hours before the fbi steps in .
teamed with rape investigator sarah sunhill ( madeleine stowe ) -- who , coincidentally enough , once had a romantic relationship with brenner --
brenner begins uncovering dark secrets from the late captain 's past that make the case ever more sordid .
if only the sordidness were the worst of the general 's daughter 's problems .
scenes of sexual degredation do linger much longer than necessary , their negligible dramatic value overwhelmed by filtered - light sleaze .
director simon west likely thinks he 's covered himself by juxtaposing these images of violence with sweet flowers , but all he does is prove himself dependent on visual cliches , which is the film 's fatal flaw .
it 's a trend he continues for two hours , taking the story 's few virtues and slapping a coat of moron - proof obviousness over them .
characters who may ( wink wink ) turn out to be villains are photographed in ominous shadow ; cutaway inserts of the captain campbell 's still - living face after the corpse is uncovered insure against five - minute attention spans .
west just ca n't help himself from overdirecting every minute of the general 's daughter .
he even turns a scene of footage shown on cnn into an excuse for slow - fade edits .
bubbling up from this overcooked stew are enough tasty lines to distract you from its smell .
the slickest scene finds brenner squaring off with captain campbell 's mentor , a psychological warfare expert named moore ( james woods ) .
there 's something invigorating about watching two smart actors playing smart characters firing honesty at one another .
indeed , travolta gets to sink his teeth into dozens of choice lines based on his delight at provoking authority figures ( to the local sheriff of the georgia county : "" should n't you be out night - sticking the colored folk ? "" ) .
even the lame device of brenner and sunhill 's sexual history provides a few winning zingers .
goldman 's dialogue can serve up a bigger laugh than you 'll find in most so - called comedies .
dialogue , unfortunately , just is n't enough to make a quality script .
it 's difficult to take a movie about a criminal investigation seriously when the investigators are both too stupid to solve it sooner ( an idiotic inability to recognize the nature of the crime scene ) and too lucky for it to last any longer ( not one but two occasions where brenner catches a vital piece of evidence out of the corner of his eye ) .
by the time the general 's daughter wanders towards its over - wrought , psycho - in - the - rain finale
, west 's heavy hand has obliterated most of what made the film occasionally fun .
it 's silly and pretentious film - making , but at least it provides a giggle or five .

"the thirteenth floor , the third in what i would call "" the reality check movie series "" , is very similar to the other reality check movies released this year , the matrix and existenz .
all three made you think , made you wonder what is real , what is n't , and if our world is just a huge game .
the thirteenth floor does n't reach the level of originality , creativity , and curiosity sparked by the matrix and existenz , but it certainly gives a great shot at it .
in the matrix , we were told that the humans are simply a virus .
in existenz , we learned that our life could be just a game .
in the thirteenth floor , we learn that we are just electronic devices , living under another world of electronic devices .
there is just one world on top of another , and everything in them are fake and electronically generated .
the thirteenth floor took a huge , risky turn that i did n't expect it to take , and i 'm not very sure it was such a great turn to make . rather than focusing just on the reality parts of the film , the thirteenth floor becomes a murder mystery that ends up tying in with the different worlds .
after the mysterious murder of computer program designer hammond fuller , played by armin mueller - stahl , douglas hall , played by craig bierko , a man that worked under fuller for many years , must travel through an electronic computer device that fuller was using , to the year 1937 , which consists of computer generated characters only .
the simulation of 1937 is just like it was back in the olden days .
all of the people involved are just characters , or are they ?
douglas strongly believes that a character traveled through the transport from their world to ours , and killed fuller .
along the way , douglas interacts with many different potential suspects , and a woman who claims to be the daughter of fuller , jane fuller , played wonderfully by a talented young actress , gretchen mol .
the thirteenth floor is a plot driven movie from the time the film gets going , and does n't use spectacular special effects and big sound to keep the viewer 's interests .
i was worried that this film would be too much like the matrix and existenz , and i would n't enjoy it , but
there were enough twists and turns to keep me thinking and attentive to the film .
unfortunately , many potential would have been great scenes were thrown away with predictable content , letting the viewer know the outcome of the scene long before it happened .
the scenes that are n't original or interesting seem to go absolutely nowhere , leaving you wondering , "" what is the point of this ?
"" sometimes it was hard to believe that this story , with terrible dialogue , some bad acting , especially from craig bierko , and scenes that go absolutely nowhere , are actually true .
i know this is n't a true story or anything , but a film should be able to make you think that it is .
on the plus side of acting , we get to see the missing from main character action since the film masterpiece shine in 1995 actor , armin mueller - stahl .
in the thirteenth floor , he is back and is still giving believable and amazing performances .
another plus is gretchen mol 's realistic performance , creating her character with depth , not just staying in the one - dimensional phase .
do n't expect the intensity of the matrix or existenz to come out of the thirteenth floor , just expect another film that messes with your mind for awhile , and shuts you down like any other movie would .
thrills , chills , and spills are n't what you will get in this film , but you will just get another trip to send your mind on , scrambling it until you 've had enough .
the bottom line- let 's hope this is the last of the "" reality check "" based movies for awhile .",1,"['on the plus side of acting', 'played wonderfully by a talented', 'there were enough twists and turns to keep me thinking and attentive', 'realistic performance', 'creating her character with depth , not just staying in the one - dimensional phase', 'is still giving believable and amazing performances']"
"naturally , at the core of leon gast 's "" when we were kings "" is the fight itself , for what a fight it was .
thanks to the business savvy of don king , an ageing muhammad ali was pitted against the formidable hulk of heavyweight champion george foreman .
fans were treated to an 8 round battle of endurance and strategy , as much as brute strength , that immediately entered boxing lore .
with the benefit of the first - hand recollections of that old ex - pug norman mailer , this classic conflict is brought back to life .
but "" when we were kings "" tackles issues that are harder to pin down than the simple facts of a boxing match .
questions of political power and social justice appear throughout this documentary .
gast could hardly choose otherwise , considering the vocal , uncompromising politics of muhammad ali .
a member of the controversial black separatist movement the nation of islam , ali opens gast 's film with a forceful swipe at the united states .
when ali hollers "" damn america ' , the audience knows the imprecation is heartfelt ; the brutal yet casual way it is uttered leaves no doubt that ali is speaking his mind .
his decision to buck the draft for vietnam is defended with the same admirable fury : "" no viet cong ever called me nigger "" , ali reasons .
despite showcasing ali 's proud unequivocal politics , one of the most impressive features of "" when we were kings "" is the subtle way in which the documentary considers the difficulties inherent in the overarching philosophy of black unity and black symbolism that ali and his supporters champion .
listening to the film 's numerous commentators , it is clear that the geographic location for this "" rumble in the jungle "" is etched more in the imagination than anywhere you could place on a map .
spike lee tells us that the event was a pilgrimage , a "" coming home "" to africa .
foreman reminds us that africa is the "" cradle of civilisation "" .
fair enough , but this homeland is a specific nation cursed with a less than inspiring reality .
it is the newly founded zaire and it is ruled by president mobutu , a brutal dictator .
while ali respects mobutu 's ability to forge an independent african state , mailer notes that beneath the stadium in which the titans battled lay hidden the presidents well - stocked torture chambers .
mailer 's insights are lost on most of the film 's commentators .
george plimpton recalls that he always felt he was in the congo , rather than the newly christened zaire .
with admirable restraint , gast quietly suggests that for many the grandeur of myth and history all but obscured the reality of zaire ' s squalid ruling elite .
mobutu is not the only dubious character to benefit from the heady symbolism of black power .
don king , resplendent in yellow kaftan and at ease with the "" messiah "" label attributed to him by a loyal disciple , passes himself off as the voice of a new black international solidarity .
understandably , foreman believes he has gotten a raw deal .
he may be , as one sympathiser notes , "" blacker "" than ali , but he is denied the iconic status shared by ali , the thuggish mobutu , and the tacky huckster don king .
africa , zaire , inspirational leader or vicious dictator , all is left undifferentiated , unconsidered , in this optimistic celebration of black unity .
little wonder that the people of zaire were shocked to find that ali 's opponent was n't white .
admittedly , these issues are only hinted at , rather than substantially explored .
the audience must consider the significance of these issues themselves , in their own time .
there is just too much to cover , too much that is truly worthy of celebration , for a protracted political analysis to be justified .
the excitement of james brown and b .
b king in concert , for instance .

doubtlessly , considering the multi - faceted nature of the extravaganza they chose to cover , the makers of "" when we were kings "" faced numerous difficulties in deciding what issues , and what personalities , best deserved their attention .

"kirk douglas is one of those rare american actors who can say more with a simple glance than most can say with pages of dialogue .
all he has to do is look at someone with a raised eyebrow , and you instantly know what he 's thinking .
"" detective story "" features one of kirk douglas 's finest performances .
he stars as a new york detective that has his whole world fall apart in one night .
the film is based on a play , and this is quite evident , as most of the movie takes place in the one - room flat that the detective 's work in .
the film opens with the douglas character getting ready to go home to his wife , but through a series of events , he never quite makes it there .
the bulk of the movie follows the case of a man named schneider , a surgeon who routinely performs abortions with a high fatality rate .
however , this schneider character has a connection in the past of douglas 's wife ; a connection douglas himself is not aware of .
many secrets are revealed in the last half hour of this film .
secrets i would not dream of giving away .
with a name like "" detective story "" , one would assume the film would resemble an episode of "" nypd blue "" , but it does n't quite work out that way .
however , we do see douglas at work on a few other cases throughout the running time .
lee grant ( virtually unrecognizable ) plays a meek jewish woman arrested for shoplifting .
her scenes with bendix , another detective , provide the movie with a few laughs .
the performances all around are fantastic .
douglas may be the leader of this ensemble , but he 's not the center of attention all the time .
we get to catch a glimpse into other cases and other detectives working on those cases .
which brings me back to douglas .
he has a really emotional scene towards the end of the picture that really makes you feel for him .
we can see that this is a man who has spent his whole life trying to eliminate crime , but has finally realized that what he 's really done is gotten back at his criminal father .
how he handles coming to terms with this is something really worth seeing .
kirk douglas is the kind of actor we do n't seem to see to much of these days : he 's a tough guy , but the human elements are never hidden too deeply underneath that gruff exterior .",1,"['the performances all around are fantastic', ""features one of kirk douglas 's finest performances"", 'provide the movie with a few laughs', 'something really worth seeing']"
"is jimmy stewart the greatest actor of all - time ?
it 's quite possible .
his career spanned over 40 years , and he acted in more movies than most actors ever could .
yet , when he is talked about in the media , he is generally thought of as an actor who played one type of role : the nice guy .
and that 's really a shame .
""
the naked spur "" features jimmy stewart in a role completely different than what people would expect from him .
it 's a western , which stewart specialized in around this period , and it casts him as a desperate man out to collect a bounty on a man who used to be his friend .
before he finds that man , though , he runs into two men who agree to help him , thinking he is a sheriff .
when the criminal is eventually caught , the two men discover stewart 's secret , and decide they want a piece of the action too .
the rest of the film is a suspenseful journey in which each man suspects the other constantly .
also featured is the woman travelling with the criminal , well played by janet leigh .
we 're never too sure who 's side
she 's really on until the end .
leigh is an actress probably best known for her role as the "" shower lady "" from "" psycho "" , and that 's unfair .
she gives a strong performance as a woman who is pulled between these two men .
stewart gives a performance unlike anything i 've ever seen from him .
he usually keeps cool no matter what occurs , but here , he gets downright hysterical at times .
i think perhaps he took this role to prove to the public that he was more than just a "" nice guy "" .
his performance borders on psychotic at times , but
i loved watching every second of it .
it 's roles like this one that make me admire him as much as i do .
he was an actor unafraid to take chances , and even ruin his public image .",1,"['a suspenseful journey', 'well played', 'i loved watching every second of it', 'she gives a strong performance']"
"this christmas , little ralphie parker ( peter billingsley ) wants nothing more than a red ryder bb gun under the tree .
although cautioned by many that he will ?
shoot his eye out ' , ralphie remains optimistic , conjuring up a detailed scheme to get on the good side of his parents and teachers .
it could be possible that no one has ever wanted anything with more passion than ralphie wants this bb gun , and the story of his eternal struggle is a charming one .
` a christmas story ' is a favorite among many during the holiday season , and boy ,
it is certainly easy to see why .
ralphie 's endless desire for the bb gun may transport you back to your childhood , when you were craving a certain gift for christmas and the anxiety was almost indescribable .
evoking pleasant childhood memories is only one of the many things ` a christmas story ' does so well .
here are a few features that make this film such a charming little package
for everybody during the holiday season : 1 ) period detail .
this film is based on the memoirs of late humorist jean shepard , who shares his experiences as a young boy living in the 1940 's with loving detail .
shepard narrates from a first person point - of - view , divulging his various adventures one snowy december , in which visions of taking aim with his new bb gun replaced that of sugarplums dancing in his head .
shepard 's first - hand commentary of several situations is not only downright hilarious , but also witty and warm , with various metaphorical meanings that ring perfectly with the essence of comic timing .
on top of that , young billingsley 's stupefied reactions to each predicament is absolutely perfect in contrast with the narration .
director bob clark captures the look and feel of the era with wonderful technicality .
i can hardly imagine a more accurate depiction of what christmas for young ralphie must have been like .
2 ) mom and dad .
both melinda dillon ( as mom ) and darren mcgavin ( as ?
the old man ' ) are perfect in their roles .
it 's hard to fathom a more agreeable pair for the requirements of a story like this one , with each possessing at least one memorable trait that instantly separates them from the wooden caricatures that could have been featured .
for instance , he is a bloodthirsty turkey hound , and she is forgiving and understanding when it comes to some serious issues .
in portraying the writer as a persistent but mild - mannered young lad , peter billingsley has struck quite the chord .
his performance is richly textured , making all of the humorous situations he stumbles into radiate with flavor and enjoyment . which brings us to . . . .
3 )
the comic situations .
there are plenty of memorable moments in ` a christmas story ' .
moments that undoubtedly will improve in comic potency upon each new viewing , with so much more to explore and to cherish .
i am particularly partial of the ? f - word scene ' , in which ralphie blurts out the shocking four - letter obscenity while helping the old man in the yard .
again , shepard 's method of handling this amusing scenario is nothing short of comic wizardry .
the numerous sequences that stick in one 's mind include , of course , the famous department store santa scene - in which billingsley has some problems in telling old saint nick what he wants under the tree .
i could go on , but i 'll finish on this note :
` a christmas story ' is a standout among holiday movies , because it captures so much in a meager 90 minutes .
not only is it funny ,
it 's often genuinely hilarious . . . .
not to mention warm , fluffy and touching in all the appropriate places .
i plan on making ` a christmas story ' a christmas tradition .

"it rocks - actually , lots of rocks fly at us or from us , in slow or fast motion , at several points in the film .
they seem like dangerous rocks because they kind of twirl through the air instead of just propelling forward , and when they land - once in a while , when we need a break from the space sequences - they cause damage enough to destroy the chrysler building and the like .
( nary a mention of these apocalyptic events is made after they occur . )
they also just might be the most interesting element of armageddon , a steroid user 's answer to deep impact .
bruce willis stars as harry stamper , a famed oil - driller commissioned by the white house and nasa to stop a giant asteroid before it travels beyond "" zero barrier "" and destroys our planet .
why an oil driller ?
they require someone experience with deep - core mining to plant a nuclear missile into said asteroid .
( in one unintentionally ( ? ) hilarious sequence , nasa asks harry to inspect a deep - core driller they built based on his blueprints ; it is poorly constructed - harry criticizes almost every aspect of it .
we trust nasa to build space shuttles ? )
harry assembles the obligatory "" ragtag "" bunch of "" cowboys "" , including a blond guy , a fat guy , a black guy , a wiseass , and the man who is sleeping with his daughter ( affleck ) .
once they reach space , we experience sequence after sequence of something going wrong -
perhaps the fact that they sent a bunch of nincompoops into outer space has something to do with it ; i can not count the number of times they almost fail the mission on all my fingers and toes .
whether or not they save the day , i will not reveal .
nor will you care .
i will say this : you know you 're in trouble when deep impact dwarfs your asteroid movie in terms of emotion and scope .
willis has barely a chance to come alive ; ditto for affleck .
their big scenes are mostly reserved for the third act , in a last minute - and futile - attempt to inject warmth into the material .
steve buscemi 's character - the wiseass - is exceptionally problematic .
"" rockhound "" , as he 's called , is sarcastic and foolish , so they tape him to a chair , where he spends most of the film .
so why did they bring him up there to begin with ?
rather , why write him into the film ?
-give his almost - witty one - liners to serious willis , who scowls and mopes and demonstrates psychotic tendencies : at one point he chases after affleck with his shotgun for screwing his daughter , firing often and causing significant damage to his oil rig .
i 'm guessing he qualifies under nasa guidelines as someone unfit for space travel , at least in my world where the sky is blue .
liv tyler is pretty and humourless , as always ; suspiciously , four of her father 's band 's ( "" aerosmith "" ) songs grace the soundtrack .
director michael bay lays the visual and sound effects on thick , like ketchup , eventually drowning the movie on - screen .
( the middle hour is a non - sensical , pyrotechnic assault on the average primate 's brain . )
whenever someone dies in this movie , a crew member inevitably yells out "" we lost ( insert dead person 's last name here ) !
""
i must admit that not once could i distinguish a dead oil - guy - cum - astronaut from a live one , and close - ups of the corpses ' faces beneath cracked helmets provided little assistance , as their skin was often covered in fake blood .
armageddon is not as terrible movie as godzilla .
it looks nicer , and has fewer plot - holes within its equally ludicrous framework .
it has a vivid soundmix .
but at almost two - and - a - half hours , i could not believe how little actually happened over the course of the story .
the love story has been played up in the ads , perhaps hoping to catch people before they recover from titanic - fever .
bollocks !
the lovers in the film are miles apart throughout - erase all thoughts of nude sketching or car - sex and replace them with obligatory shots of liv tyler tearing up while ben affleck dicks around in a moon - crawler .
remember a little film called jaws ?
in this film , three independent - minded men suddenly found themselves on a fishing boat in pursuit of a deadly shark .
they did n't much like each other at first ; eventually , they started to respect one another .
one of jaws ' great scenes involved the would - be - ahabs drinking and singing songs and telling stories .
this is the sort of male - bonding foreign to bay or his producer , jerry bruckheimer , who throw too many characters into the mix and expect we 'll care about them on the grounds that the world is about to end .
not once do we get the feeling that these characters are even acquaintances - i'd be surprised if these actors bothered to introduce themselves to one another before "" action "" was called .
a male friend who loved the film suggested to me that perhaps i can not relate to a bunch of men who do n't bare their souls , who believe in dying macho concepts like heroism and a kind of chest - beating bravery .
to this , i will respond that the boys in armageddon are neither heroic , nor brave , nor smart , even : this team could n't build a birdhouse .
and if i get no respect for disliking a movie with all the synthetic feeling of a trailer - a trailer for a movie written by a team of body - builders and greeting card authors - i've never been a prouder wimp my whole life .",0,"['this is the sort of male - bonding foreign', 'has barely a chance to come alive', 'i could not believe how little actually happened over the course of the story', 'throw too many characters into the mix']"
"when i left the theater after seeing david lynch 's "" lost highway , "" i remarked to a fellow movie - goer , "" i feel like someone just sucked my brains out through my nose and put them back in through my ears .
"" in his first feature film in five years , lynch delivers a film second only to his debut picture "" eraserhead "" on the weirdness scale .
you wo n't "" know "" what happened when it 's over , though there are certainly enough clues with which to make some reasonable guesses .
it is difficult to describe the plot of this film , because it depends partly on how you interpret it .
i can , however , describe what we see on the screen : l . a . jazz saxophonist fred madison ( bill pullman ) and his wife renee ( patricia arquette ) , whom he clearly suspects of infidelity , receive a series of videotapes apparently filmed inside their house while they were asleep .
they are , naturally enough , more than a little frightened and confused , and it does n't help matters any when "" mystery man "" ( robert blake ) approaches fred at a party and proceeds to call himself on the telephone at the madisons ' house in a scene that is at once hilarious and unnerving .
the next morning , fred finds another videotape which , to his ( and our ) surprise , shows him brutally murdering renee in their bedroom .
he is convicted of her murder and sent to death row , where he inexplicably disappears one night and is replaced by a young mechanic named pete dayton ( balthazar getty ) .
the perplexed prison officials release dayton , whose life begins to intersect with fred in a number of ways - most notably his affair with alice wakefield ( arquette again ) , a blonde who is otherwise renee 's spitting image , and another encounter with the mystery man .
i would be giving away a little too much to reveal any more , but suffice it to say that lynch does n't offer any neat wrap ?
ups , nor does he put a lid on the metaphysical confusion : the cinematic demons of "" lost highway "" are out in full force from beginning to end .
this description might make "" lost highway "" sound like a giddy exercise in haywire surrealism , but in fact , while there are traces of lynch 's weird sense of humor , this film is anything but giddy most of the time .
on the contrary , lost highway is a dark and perplexing mystery that takes lynch 's previous excursions into murder and intrigue one step farther .
the film does not revolve around a character investigating a mystery ; rather , the character * is * the mystery .
there are recurring and at times deeply disturbing images of suspicion , distrust , and infidelity
thoughout the film that seem to indicate a deluded , fractured psyche at the root of all the bizarre goings - on here .
we , the audience , are left to puzzle out whose psyche it is that is driving this ( probably fred 's , in my opinion ) and what , in that case , the other characters and events are meant to represent .
all of this proceeds , appropriately , in lynch 's typically slow - paced , idiosyncratic style .
as is often the case , lynch relies on sound , imagery , and mood more than on dialogue and action to tell his story , and in "" lost highway
"" it works perfectly .
there are scenes when the camera lingers on fred 's blank expression as he drifts uncomfortably down a hallway , or on his pained face in his prison cell while the haunting strains of this mortal coil 's "" song to the siren "" can be heard faintly in the background ; nothing is technically "" happening "" in these scenes , yet they present a vivid picture of a man losing his grip just as effective as , if not more so than , the hysterical screaming found in most movie presentations of insanity .
lynch 's direction and director of photography pete deming 's darkly lit cinematography serve to create a nearly suffocating atmosphere of tension and fear
that are exactly what is needed for this story .
well , most of the time , anyway - i have to admit that i was a bit bored at times during the section of the film with pete dayton as the protgaonist , which is less inherently interesting and mostly keeps the viewer 's attention because of its tie - ins to the original mystery .
the main characters in this "" reality "" - dayton ( a well - meaning but none too intelligent 24-year - old ) , a sleazy gangster ( who for some reason has two names but otherwise is pretty much a stock character ) , and his porn - star girlfriend ( the blond arquette ) - are nothing you could n't find in any of the two dozen "" pulp fiction "" wannabes ; fortunately , the reappearance of the mystery man as well as some other typically lynchian elements , such as the strained , awkward conversations between pete and his parents , help to preserve the film 's spooky , unnerving tone during this stretch .
lynch 's typically graphic and disturbing portrayals of fringe sexuality , while relevant to the themes of jealousy and adultery , are also somewhat overdone here .
it 's not exactly exploitative - like almost everything else in this film , the sex is thoroughly weird and creepy and is unlikely to provide any cheap lurid thrills - as much as it is unnecessary and frankly kind of dumb by the seventh or eighth time arquette takes her clothes off .
that said , these minor flaws do n't prevent "" lost highway "" from attaining its place as one of the darkest , most unsettling films to hit the screens in recent years .
it is a one - way ride down the lost highway of a disturbed mind , and as such it is gripping , intense , and brilliantly effective .",1,"[""help to preserve the film 's spooky , unnerving tone"", 'it works perfectly', 'gripping , intense , and brilliantly effective', 'attaining its place', 'that are exactly what is needed for this story', 'appropriately']"
"i 've got to admit it . . .
i 'm a huge jim carrey fan .
i loved the first ace ventura , as well as the mask and dumb and dumber -- and even in batman forever ( which was a pretty awful movie ) , carrey was one of the few people to come off looking reasonably good .
until i saw ace ventura 2 , i had no idea how people could find the guy annoying .
sadly , ace ventura 2 shows
just how irritating and annoying carrey can be .
carrey goes through the same schtick
he went through in the first ace movie , but this time
it is no longer funny -- it is just a rehash of many of the same jokes used in ace i .
the plot sees pet detective ace ventura retiring after failing to save a raccoon ( in a reasonable cliffhanger spoof ) .
soon he is called out of retirement to find a bat which was kidnapped and , if not returned in four days , will cause two warring african tribes to destroy each other .
once again , it 's up to ace to save the day , using his uncanny detective skills .
those who have been disappointed by carrey 's more restrained roles in the films following the first ace ventura may be glad to see him over - acting to the best of his ability , but some may be disappointed by the fact that this sequel does n't capture the feel of the original .
the original benefited from what looked to be carrey 's constant hyped - up improv sequences , which were hysterically funny .
here , however , the tighter script ( which is reminiscent of the old disney telemovies ) takes the improvised material from the first , and
shamelessly recycles it in the new movie , giving carrey little chance to improvise .
instead , his extremely funny manner has been reduced to just walking around stupidly .
but one of the biggest problems
i had was with the character of ventura himself .
in the first movie , he was always cool , and one step ahead of every one else -- perfect for carrey 's off - the - wall approach .
but here , ventura is made to look a lot stupider , and is often made out as the straight guy -- a role which is definitely not carrey 's style .
there are definitely some very funny moments , but they are few and far between .
they are also nowhere near as funny as anything carrey did in the first ace ventura , or even dumb and dumber .",0,"['nowhere near as funny', 'it is no longer funny -- it is just a rehash', 'just how irritating and annoying', 'disappointed', 'one of the biggest problems', 'shamelessly recycles it', 'they are few and far between', 'over - acting to the best of his ability']"
"even though i have the utmost respect for richard dreyfuss as an actor , his presence in a motion picture does not guarantee any particular level of quality .
like everyone else , dreyfuss has bills to pay , so he occasionally accepts big paychecks for prominent roles in bad movies .
consequently , while his career highlights include jaws , close encounters of the third kind , stakeout , and tin men , his resume is dotted with titles like moon over parador , let it ride , and now krippendorf 's tribe .
let me start out by saying that krippendorf 's tribe is occasionally funny ( although never riotously so ) , but that 's about its only asset .
the best word to describe this film is "" asinine .
"" the target audience would appear to be recent nursery school graduates if not for the numerous sexual innuendoes , which are aimed at someone going through puberty .
krippendorf 's tribe tries to be a zany , off - the - wall comedy , but the film makers have forgotten three important rules .
the first is that some minimal level of plot credibility has to exist .
the second is that viewers should be able to identify with , or at least care about , a character or two . finally , and most importantly , more than 5 % of the jokes have to work .
once upon a time , james krippendorf ( dreyfuss ) was a respected professor of anthropology at little bounderby college .
he and his wife obtained a grant to seek out a "" lost tribe "" somewhere in the wilds of new guinea , a goal which they never accomplished .
shortly after their return from the failed trip , krippendorf 's wife died and he was left with the herculean task of raising three children -- shelly ( natasha lyonne ) , mickey ( gregory smith ) , and edmund ( carl michael linder ) -- on his own .
now , over a year later , the college wants to see the results of the money they gave krippendorf ( which he has spent not on research , but on things for his family ) , so they send a new member of their faculty , professor veronica micelli ( jenna elfman ) , to inform him that he has been scheduled to give a lecture on his findings .
when he arrives at the college for the momentous event , rather than telling the truth and risking being sent to jail for misappropriating school funds , he fabricates a tale about a mythical lost tribe , the "" shelmikedmu "" . to provide video footage , he films his children dressed in native garb .
soon , much to krippendorf 's surprise , the shelmikedmu are a national phenomenon .
but one disaffected professor ( lily tomlin ) is determined to prove that the tribe is a fraud .
the only way krippendorf 's tribe works is if you assume that all of the characters ( not to mention the viewers ) are dumber than dirt .
unfortunately , it 's impossible to like or sympathize with a bunch of putzes like this .
director todd holland completely fails to develop any character into something more substantial than a device to implement various dubious gags .
meanwhile , attempts at satirizing the shallowness of american culture ( i .
e .
, how easily the public can be fooled into jumping on the bandwagon of the latest trend ) come across as feeble and derivative .
the acting in underwhelming .
dreyfuss has definitely not given his "" all "" to the role of james krippendorf .
alongside him , jenna elfman , the spunky co - star of tv 's dharma and greg , radiates perkiness and little else .
this quality , while fine for a 22-minute television program , quickly becomes irritating in the arena of a feature - length movie .
no one in the supporting cast -- lily tomlin , david ogden stiers , natasha lyonne
( woody allen 's daughter in everyone says i love you ) -- excels .
i know that a movie 's in trouble when it 's half the length of titanic , but seems much longer .
most of what comes on screen is generic sit - com level material -- the kind of slop that people will absorb while dozing off in their favorite easy chair in front of the television set .
if there 's any upside , it 's that i do n't see much box - office support developing for this lame , ill - marketed miscue .
krippendorf 's tribe will quickly become extinct .",0,"[""unfortunately , it 's impossible to like or sympathize with a bunch of putzes like this"", 'quickly becomes irritating', 'come across as feeble and derivative . the acting in underwhelming', 'the best word to describe this film is "" asinine .

"the scene at the end of 1989 's ` dead poets society , ' when robin williams ' english students stand up on their desk and say , ` captain , my captain , ' gets me every time .
unfortunately , the court room scene near the end of robin 's newest film , ` patch adams , ' does n't have anywhere near the same impact .
from the surface ` patch adams ' looks very promising .
it 's a story about a not so young man , patch adams ( robin williams ) , who finds meaning in his life through helping sick people .
when the film opens , we find patch , depressed and suicidal , checking himself into a mental hospital .
in a few scenes , strongly reminiscent of ` one flew over the cuckoo 's nest , ' he ends up helping the patients through their problems ; and it 's here that he finds how much he loves working with people .
so he checks himself out of the hospital , and heads straight to medical school .
right from the start , patch uses comedy to help make the patient more comfortable .
he continuously breaks medical tradition and makes the dean of the school angry .
shortly after joining medical school , he meets and falls in love with carin ( monica potter ) .
they , along with patch 's dork friend , truman ( daniel london ) , start a medical clinic for uninsured people .
once the dean catches wind of the clinic , he tells patch he ca n't graduate and kicks him out of school .
patch , like what any true american would do , takes the school to court .
it 's here where the not so climatic court room battle takes place , over whether or not patch can become a real doctor .
i have never seen a movie with some potential
just completely blow it .
it seems more like a series of short sketches , rather than a full - length movie .
considering it runs almost two hours , much too long for such a light film , it could have flowed much smoother .
not to mention the fact of how serious the film takes itself , and manages to cover all the cliches of bad melodrama .
robin williams saves the film from being abysmal with several comic scenes that elevate the movie to entertaining and worthwhile levels .

"the real blonde ( r ) a woman 's face , an arm , some pumped - up pectorals , blond hair , a man 's sad face , slender legs , a random hand here and there .
as the opening credits of tom dicillo 's the real blonde unfold , these scattered , fractured glimpses eventually come together to form the image of a bikini brief - clad man on his knees clinging to a nurturing woman , his head concealing her unclothed breasts .
if only the rest of this formless , aimless ensemble comedy assembled so coherently .
joe ( matthew modine ) is a waiter / struggling actor too proud to take gigs in commercials or soap operas .
he 's feeling somewhat dissatisfied with his relationship with his live - in love , mary ( catherine keener ) , who holds some subconscious hostility toward the male gender .
mary , a makeup artist , regularly works on model sahara ( bridgette wilson ) , who is obsessed with the underlying messages in disney 's the little mermaid .
the bottle blonde has a turbulent on - again , off - again relationship with bob ( maxwell caulfield ) , a soap actor who yearns for the taste of a real blonde , which he finds in co - star kelly ( daryl hannah ) . as the film unspools , a variety of other characters pass through : fashion photographer blair ( marlo thomas ) ; mary 's shrink ( buck henry ) and self - defense instructor ( denis leary ) ; joe 's casting agent ( kathleen turner ) and hardass boss ( christopher lloyd ) ; and a mystery woman ( elizabeth berkley ) who keeps on crossing joe 's path .
where exactly does all this go ?
that 's a question best posed to writer - director dicillo , who does n't appear to have the slightest clue himself .
his meandering , largely unfunny script and direction are like hopelessly lost drivers , turning into dead - end narrative streets only to reverse course and hit another creative cul - de - sac . and another .
and another .
at one point bob , frustrated with the soap scripts , complains to the head writer ( jim fyfe ) that his and kelly 's characters keep on going in circles , with no hint of development or growth .
that is most certainly the case here .
joe gets a job and ultimately botches things ; he and mary bicker ; they make up , only to have the pattern repeat itself .
unhappy with his bottle blonde , bob gets his real blonde but is unsatisfied ; he returns to the faux and is still unsatisfied .
if there is a point to all of this , dicillo dances around it , spending his time on apparent digressions that , as it turns out , are n't digressions at all .
the real blonde is not without some amusements .
it does have the occasional funny line and situation ; leary , henry , lloyd , steve buscemi , and dave chappelle shine in their small roles ; keener is a likable , refreshingly earthy lead ; berkley 's appearance is mercifully brief ( she receives outrageously prominent billing and ad placement for a ten - minute role ) ; and there is the irony of having caulfield play a wildly popular soap star who makes the ratings skyrocket (
last year , the actor was fired from the daytime drama all my children after a scant six months -- due to lack of viewer interest ) .
but on the whole , the real blonde is a frustrating sit that lives up to the stereotypes of its title -- it may be glossy on the surface , but there 's nothing going on inside .

"vampires starts out almost in the style of a spaghetti western with an attack on a small homestead in new mexico .
the house has a nest of vampires and jack crow ( james woods ) is leading a team of vampire hunters in to clean them out .
while the initial imagery is a little over - dramatic , it gives way to what is a fairly decent action sequence .
that is enough action to last us a while
and we could , director john carpenter would let us , get to a story line .
but it is not very long and there is not much plot until the next big action scene .
then there is only a bit more of plot before the next action scene after that .
the plot is kept to a minimum and the interesting ideas in the plot really get the short end .
and that is something of a pity because the film , based on the book vampire$ by john steakley , gives us a myth for the origins of vampires and explains why vampires are so intertwined with religious imagery .
this could be an interesting departure from the standard vampire film , but carpenter decides to tell us about it rather than to show it .
what carpenter saves his serious screen time for a sequence of spectacular fights between hunters and vampires .
there is a lot of fighting and lots of gore .
anything intriguing is kept to a minimum to so it does not get in the way of pleasing the action film fans .
this has not always been carpenter 's style .

in the early part of the film his team is wiped out by a particularly mean vampire valek ( thomas ian griffith ) who has been tipped off to who crow is .
now crow team is gone and he is down to himself and his sidekick tony montoya ( daniel baldwin ) . to make matters worse
, he does not know the people on his own side , tony and his backers , he can trust .
meanwhile jack is sure the vampires are looking for something that must be hidden somewhere here in new mexico .
if this is sounding like a very tired police corruption plot with a few obvious substitutions , that 's exactly what it is .
the same story looks just as well with two partner cops looking for a gang of hood who are themselves looking for a packet of heroin .
but carpenter goes against a familiar principle of film : show people , do n't tell them .
just about everything in the plot other than the fights we are told about in the dialog and not shown .
fundamental questions in the plot like where does crow get his funding
, why are the vampires in new mexico -- what do they want and why do they want it
, what is the connection of the vampires and the catholic church , how did crow come to be a vampire hunter and why devote his life to it ?
the answers to any of these questions could have been dramatized , but instead are revealed through dialog .
now if all this was not bad enough , carpenter misuses the james wood persona .
woods plays a particular sort of cool lowlife very well .
but carpenter leads off the film by having woods do some sergio - leone- style mythic posturing .
while his crew prepares for an attack he stands staring fixedly through shades at the house that will be his target .
woods does not work as a larger than life mythic hero .
that is not his style and it just does not work very well .
there are some simple things that carpenter should be looking for as director that he misses .
in one scene we are looking at a motel room with dead people on the floor .
one female corpse is on the floor in front of a chair so that there is about an inch of daylight between her and the chair .
as the actress breathes the gap widening and narrowing makes it obvious her arm is moving up and down .
one also wonders how the existence of vampires is kept secret .
these vampires do not maintain a low profile .
there are arguably logical flaws in the film .
there is some question in my mind whether carpenter has a consistent policy on what effect bullets have on vampires .
it would take some rationalization to explain why in some scenes sunlight has a dramatic effect on vampires , yet in a scene toward the end a vampire can walk under a burned roof that lets him be swept by beams of sunlight .
i suspect that the book on which this film was based was better thought out .
while i might recommend this film to an action audience i would say that what i look for in a vampire film vampires rates a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale .
perhaps i will read the book .",0,"['there are arguably logical flaws in the film', 'anything intriguing is kept to a minimum', 'something of a pity', 'does not work', 'the plot is kept to a minimum and the interesting ideas in the plot really get the short end', 'a very tired police corruption plot with a few obvious substitutions', 'if all this was not bad enough , carpenter misuses']"

after seeing the movie speed twice recently , i kept thinking that i was seeing wyatt 's life pass before my eyes in real time .
this movie was boring , slow , boring , and slow .
there were a few scenes that tried to be great scenes that tried too hard and just fell flat .

the movie is torture to sit through .
the scenery is boring .
the fades were either awkward or cliche or to self important .
can you say poor editing

when you shoot people from under their chins , they look like they have double chins .
kevin costner has never looked worse .
he should sue .
he looks like he gained the 43 pounds that dennis quaid lost .
dennis quaid is marvelous . if you have to see this movie just for his performance , go into the theatre at the movie 's halfway mark .
doc holliday ( quaid 's character ) shows up at about the 90-minute mark .
gene hackman is very good .
is he in the credits ?
i do n't remember seeing his name .

"we all know the fate of "" child 's play , "" which is the same for almost any film these days that does marginally well financially : sequel hell .
with the newest installment in the quasi - popular series currently out ( that would be "" bride of chucky "" - and it grossed 11 million in its opening weekend , which i think is the sign of the apocalypse number five )
, it 's kinda fun to go back and see how it all began rougly ten years ago with the original , a task which is a retread for some , and for others ( namely myself ) a chance to see what all the fuss was about .
alas , the original "" child 's play "" actually is n't that bad .
even seeing it in the tiny , claustrophobic , and mechanically - challenged theatre at my college was n't the horribly dull experience i thought it would be , not just because of the nicely rowdy crowd ( which you almost need to watch a film like this - and if you do n't believe me , try and watch this flick by yourself one day ) , but because as a whole , this is n't a bad movie .
it 's not great , but it does have two things that many horror films like this one do n't have : 1 )
a rather nifty premise , and 2 ) a sense of humor , both which save this from horror hell , which is precisely where , say , "" i know what you did last summer "" has recently gone .
the premise of "" child 's play "" is that a serial killer named charles lee ray ( brad douriff ) is shot and almost killed by a chicago hard - boiled detective ( chris surrandon - see what happens to some oscar nominees ? ) , and before he dies , utters a voodoo chant that sends his soul directly into a kid 's doll called chucky , a doll which has got to be the scariest - looking kid 's doll i 've ever seen .
the next day , a bum who 's stolen it sells it to single - mother karen barclay ( catherine hicks ) , who then gives it to her young son andy ( alex vincent ) for his birthday .
of course chucky begins talking to the kid and trying to find a way to get out of the doll , but certain twists come up .
like the guy he learned voodoo from reveals to him that the only way to break the curse is to take over the body of the first person he told he was inside the doll , that being andy .
and soon enough , chucky is killing people either for revenge or for what seems like fun , and people are discovering that chucky is n't just a kiddie doll one by one .
the idea is a neat one , ripe for lots of comic terror , and luckily it utlizes a lot of that .
it plays with an idea stolen from a classic looney toons short that when someone knows that chucky is alive , they tell people about it , but when he tries to prove themselves , chucky does nothing , and everyone thinks they 're crazy .
it plays with this , as well as the whole child - like thought that dolls and toys come to life , and even manages to cram in a couple really frightening moments .
even if there 's an entire sequence devoted to cliches ( a woman alone in a house hears a noise , goes to investigate it , and finds nothing , but wait for the kicker a second later ! ) , there 's also a harrowing car ride with chucky trying to knife the detective from the back seat , and then trying to attack him when the car finally crashes , leaving the viewer with at least rather visceral exprience .
the ending is rather fun , as well , albeit a tad too drawn - out ( about four different endings , maybe five ) , and the characters are more intelligent than the average horror film line - up , making them easier to sympathize with . if there 's one horrible thing about many horror films , it 's that the protagonists are morons who you ca n't help but shout obscenities at , and for the most part , "" child 's play "" steers away from that .
and most of all , the chucky character is a good one , not just because he provides instant comic relief ( look !
that doll 's moving on its own ! ) , but because he 's a generally scary character .
if there 's anything really wrong with "" child 's play , "" it 's that it 's too trite and has too less self esteem .
at almost 90 minutes , "" child 's play "" features way too less to be a real classic of horror .
it throws itself into a simple three act set - up that renders it quick and almost forgettable if it were n't for the fact that the film deals with a psychotic doll .
if the film had more confidence in what it was presenting , it would really push the envelope and become even more than just a short bit of horror escapism , which is precisely why this kind of film is only memorable as a cheap little horor film . . . which is n't necessarily a bad thing .
as such , "" child 's play "" is content to be just the short , typical horror film , but saves itself via a sense of humor and a nice quasi - campy feel that makes it much more enjoyable than the average short , typical horror film .",1,"['the characters are more intelligent', 'the ending is rather fun', 'much more enjoyable', ""this is n't a bad movie"", 'the idea is a neat one', 'saves itself via a sense of humor', 'a rather nifty premise']"
"a costume drama set in the 1500s , england , elizabeth is a lush , romantic , political masterpiece about the upset over the crossing of a protestant queen from a respected catholic one .
when the court and country are a whole after the passing of the queens , the royal family , so to speak , are upset that a protestant should be crowened , and not another catholic , plus , the new queen , elizabeth i ( cate blanchette ) , was the bastard baby of the previous queen mary 's father .

"curdled is a deliciously dark and witty black comedy , but its humour wo n't appeal to everyone .
to be specific , let me give you an example .
do you know in pulp fiction where jules and vincent go on brain detail after marvin and his head accidentally get separated ?
if you thought that was completely tasteless and unfunny , do n't see curdled .
on the other hand , if you found that sequence to be pretty funny , you have the sense of humour that curdled is aimed at .
our film 's heroine , gabriela , played by angela jones , is a woman obssessively curious about murder and serial killers ; she even keeps a scrapbook of news articles .
luckily for her , miami is being plagued by a serial killer rampage - her scrapbook is getting pretty big .
the killer 's nickname in the press is the blue blood killer , because he preys on older rich socialite women , and he 's played by william baldwin ( this is not a spoiler ) .
one particularly striking m .
o . on the blue blood killer is his propensity to decapitate his victims .
gabriela is watching television one day when she spots an advertisement for a firm whose line of work is perfectly attuned to her interests .
she immediately quits her job , and signs on with pfcs , which stands for post - forensic cleaning service .
no points for guessing what they do .
her workmates are confused by gabriela 's fascination with murder ; to them , it 's just a day job .
there 's a hilarious locker room scene where they debate whether decapitated heads can talk , and what they would say .
gabriela 's partner , elena , played by mel gorham , is particularly perturbed by gabriela 's wide - eyed fascination , and becomes really upset when gabriela volunteers them to clean up the blue blood killer 's latest scene - they 're the messiest , you see .
unbeknownst to them , the last victim left something on the scene which would i d the blue blood killer , so he 's also heading over there . .
the comparison to pulp fiction earlier on was not accidental - quentin tarantino executive - produced this film , which began life as a short film he saw at a film festival .
apparently tarantino was so impressed that he helped braddock convert this into a feature - length film .
there are other parallels
- the star of curdled is angela jones ( the top billing goes to william baldwin , but really , jones is the central character ) , who 's probably best known for her role as esmerelda villalobos , the death - obssessed taxi driver in pulp fiction .
that role was written specifically for jones based upon her similar character in the aforementioned short film , curdled jr .
jones is great in curdled - she 's wonderfully funny and maintains an amusing wide - eyed naive curiousity about murder without compromising her character 's innocence or likeability .
she can express so much with one lift of her eyebrow .
it 's a great performance .
reb braddock 's direction is extremely sharp and clever , toeing the line between black humour and bad taste .
the best scene in the film is an outrageously funny sequence involves jones and dancing -
any more than that would be a spoiler .
the opening credit sequence is also inventive and amusing .
of course , it 's impossible to really take this stuff seriously , but then again you 're not really supposed to - braddock knows the audience is in on the joke , and makes it a fun little romp as a result .
the one drawback of curdled is that it was based on a short film , and it feels like it ; the material is just stretched too thin in order to fulfill a feature length running time , and some parts just seem to drag .
while its running time is already a short 94 minutes , it could really stand to lose twenty minutes or so to give it better pacing .
curdled seems destined to be a nice cult film for miramax .
it 'll be interesting to see if it will appeal to mainstream audiences as well .",1,"['is extremely sharp and clever', ""it 's a great performance"", 'makes it a fun little romp as a result', 'an outrageously funny sequence', 'seems destined to be a nice cult film', 'wonderfully funny and maintains an amusing wide - eyed naive curiousity', 'jones is great', 'is also inventive and amusing', ""there 's a hilarious locker room scene"", 'the star of', 'a deliciously dark and witty black comedy']"
"along his carreer , mel gibson has collected several successes , not only from an economic point of view but also from an artistic point of view .
for all that , i think no one could guess the skills and abilities now disclosed in braveheart .
the australian actor decided to produce and direct a film about sir william wallace , a popular scotch hero of the 13th century , where he would also perform the principal role . accepting so huge challenge , mel gibson run the risk of stain all his work of years , with a suppoosed failure , just to see recognized , by everyone , all his potentialities and , that way , to consolidate his position in hollywood .
it was , definitely , an enormous risk
but i 'm sure mel knew exactly well what he was going to face .
braveheart is , in fact , a magnificent and magisterial film .
for three hours we are completely absorbed by the narrative 's rhyitm which never gives place to a single moment of monotony or uninterest .
the william wallace 's story is the story of so many others brave liberty 's defenders who fought and gave the life for that essential value , along the centuries .
seeing himself and his people victims of injustices and violent repression , william wallace dares to face the powerful edward i , king of england , in a war by the autonomy of scotland .
as the victories succeed the number of fighters with wallace goes growing up .
his courage and inteligence are admired by everyone , including the princess isabelle of wales , wife of edward 's son .
however , william wallace was also surrounded by enemies and some of them were closer than he thought .
braveheart may not be an historically corrected movie but the nature of its message make us think about the importance that we give to liberty , nowadays .
mel gibson directs with a lot of brilliancy a brilliant cast .
patrick mcgoohan has a very nice performance
as edward i , the king longshank .
the scene when he waits for the death and loses his voice is really good .
sophie marceau , as princess isabelle , has along the movie no more than fifteen minutes of performance but mel gibson gave to those minutes such a very special treatment that princess isabelle soon becomes one of the major characters in braveheart .
i also liked the performances of angus macfadyen , as robert the bruce , and , of course , mel gibson , as william wallace .
however , i think this time the mel gibson 's work as director was much better than his work as actor .
the excellent music composed by james horner is another thing that helps braveheart to be the success that it really is .
when we join that music to the beautiful scotch landscapes , view by the camera of john toll , then we realize all the beauty of this film .
braveheart is , in my opinion ,
one of the best movies of 1995 !
i 've heard some people saying that mel gibson is gon na be a new david lean .
for now , let 's see if braveheart equalizes the 6 oscars of lawrence of arabia .
it wo n't be easy !
it 's gon na be one more challenge for mel gibson .",1,"['directs with a lot of brilliancy a brilliant cast', 'excellent music', 'a magnificent and magisterial film', 'really good', 'completely absorbed', 'i also liked the performances', 'one of the best', 'has a very nice performance']"
"the ultimate match up between good and evil , "" the untouchables "" is an excellent movie because it looks deeper into an already examined rivalry .
based on the 1959 television show of the same title , "" the untouchables "" may be an exaggeration of the real life events that took place , but it fits together perfectly with some beautifully filmed action sequences , some excellent acting , a memorable score , and a clever script .
the film takes place in chicago during the prohibition era where mobsters led by the ruthless al capone run an underground market of liquor to the demanding public .
elliot ness and a small force of men known as the untouchables attempt the impossible by trying to stop capone and trying to maintain peace and order .
however , as ness soon learns , in order to stabilize peace , you have to bend a few laws .
the fact that capone is evil is very apparent from the first few scenes .
the film begins with capone , played perfectly by deniro , declaring that he is not a violent man and he is a firm believer in following all laws .
the film then quickly transfers to the next scene in which one of capone 's men bombs a restaurant that contains many innocent people including a little girl .
from this point we know capone is evil , not only because he kills without hesitation , but also because he is a lying bastard .
right from the first five minutes of the film , de palma has created a hatred towards capone and he shows that this man must be brought down at all costs .
this developed hatred is before the film 's hero , ness , is even introduced .
i found this approach to be very clever because in a small duration of time there is a great amount of admiration for ness and an equal amount of hatred for capone .
the film only gets better from this point .
with the formation of the untouchables , there is a group of men wearing long , dark overcoats and hats .
they walk in unison and they only look forward .
as they walk down the streets they are observed and feared by citizens .
holding shot guns and pistols in their hands to stop criminals , this image of vigilantes must have influenced future films .
one that comes to mind is "" the matrix "" when neo , morpheus , trinity , and the rest of the gang first come into the virtual world . wearing more futuristic outfits of the same 1930 's style , the similarities between these two are countless .
""
the untouchables "" has some of the hippest , bravest heroes in any action film .
the four members were the only ones willing to go against capone 's army .
each member of this special group also had their own characteristics that separated them from others .
elliot ness , played with perfect ingenuity by kevin costner , is a character that surely grows during the course of the film .
he begins as a man who is determined to follow all laws no matter how unfair they may be .
however , as the film develops so does ness .
his beliefs involving the law are shattered when he realizes that those he trusted are actually members of the other side .
he also begins to lose his stability when his adversaries begin to murder his friends .
his anger becomes so thunderous that he can no longer hold it in .
sean connery , who won an academy award for best supporting actor in his role , plays malone ,
an aging cop who decides to make one final run as a member of the untouchables .
malone acts as a mentor to ness .
he teaches him "" the chicago way "" to do things ; when they attack with a knife , you attack with a gun .
connery plays his character with the exact amount of wit and experience needed .
andy garcia does a wonderful job as george stone , a young man who is just becoming a police officer .
as ness grows , he begins to teach stone some valuable lessons that malone once taught him .
charles martin smith is also fantastic as the final member who attempts to use an income tax offense against capone .
smith is perfect for his role as he adds some valuable comic relief to the film .
the action scenes are also some of the most beautifully choreographed i have ever seen . also very similar to "" the matrix , "" they are exciting and intense .
> from a western - like battle to the famous confrontation at the train station steps ,
the scenes are well thought out and well executed .
the score during these scenes ingeniously adds to the excitement .
its pounding drum beats act as a rhythm for the actors .
the combination of image and music is very impressive and also very effective .
although the real life untouchables may have been excessively glorified , this film is pure entertainment and contains a unique blend of great acting , great directing , and great action .
some scenes ( capone and the baseball bat , the train station ) have stuck in my mind for years and seeing them again will only make them more vivid .",1,"['i found this approach to be very clever', 'the action scenes are also some of the most beautifully choreographed i have ever seen', 'is an excellent movie', 'pure entertainment and contains a unique blend of great acting , great directing , and great action', 'played with perfect ingenuity', 'the film only gets better from this point', 'is also fantastic', 'the score during these scenes ingeniously adds to the excitement', 'it fits together perfectly with some beautifully filmed action sequences , some excellent acting , a memorable score , and a clever script', 'is very impressive and also very effective', 'the scenes are well thought out and well executed']"
"you think that these people only exist in the movies , but trust me , they 're as real as life .
i once talked to a guy who thought the united states government was putting satellites into orbit which could fry an individual person 's brain with microwaves .
then i sat in a room full of people who believed that the government rigged state elections .
i even listened to a man who swore that nicotine was an additive that cigarette companies put in their products for the specific goal of getting people addicted .
these people had what are known as "" conspiracy theories "" - ideas about how unseen forces work to deceive and control the public .
a little imagination goes a long way .
in richard donner 's conspiracy theory , jerry fletcher ( mel gibson ) is a new york city cab driver who seems to have a conspiracy theory about everything .
his latest , that nasa is trying to kill the president by causing an earthquake from the space shuttle , might sound outrageous to us , but is all in a day 's work for him .
he combs the newspaper , looking for tidbits that leave telltale warnings about the goings - on behind the scenes , and from there jerry draws his conclusions .
upstanding citizen that he is , he tries to convince alice sutton ( julia roberts ) of the justice department that the president must be warned .
lucky gal , alice , who met jerry when he saved her from a couple of muggers and has had to listen to his theories during the six months since .
what she does n't know is that jerry 's interest in her is far more than , well , professional .
he goes to great lengths to follow her around and watch her in her own apartment .
but when some secret government types seem to take an interest in jerry 's ideas and his limited - circulation "" conspiracy theory "" newsletter , he finds himself in danger and in real need of alice 's help .
one of the problems with conspiracy theory is that it tries to pass itself off as an action - thriller when it seems to have neither a whole lot of action , nor a significant number of thrills .
part of this is a result of the film 's slow pace .
it takes forever to set up the relationship between jerry and alice , and even once that is over with , the rest of the film seems to be a lot of boredom that every once in a while stops to take a break for excitement .
at over two hours , this film could have been significantly condensed and had it 's running time shortened by twenty minutes to half an hour , but even then , the action scenes would not be able to save the film .
instead of truly exciting and engaging set pieces , we 're treated to a few of the generic scenes with the requisite "" black elements "" : black helicopter , men in black action suits and body armor , black vehicles -
you know the drill .
they come on down with all kinds of neat gadgets and weapons , but for some reason a guy with just a bunch of theories and some chick with no training somehow manage to elude them every time .
big deal , we 've seen it all before .
watching the film , i wished donner had at least tried to use a little imagination , but i was out of luck .
now , when i say it took forever to set up the "" relationship "" between jerry and alice , i completely mean what one person is relative to the other , and not romantic involvement .
oh , donner and screenwriter brian helgeland would like you to believe that by the end of the movie , the two main characters will end up falling hopelessly in love with each other , but there seems to be no evidence of that ever occurring .
you see , there were more sparks between gibson and danny glover in the lethal weapon movies ( also directed by donner ) than between gibson and roberts in conspiracy theory .
the two just do n't click , and when you throw in a number of happenings that would cause alice to reject jerry altogether ( like finding out he 's been stalking her ) , the subsequent attraction is absolutely forced .
the script in general also seems forced , like someone sat helgeland down and forced him to write it , then took it and forced it upon us .
dialog is undistinguished and rather unmemorable , to the point that i almost stopped listening .
even gibson 's usual gift for ad lib could n't punch up the film sufficiently to raise my interest , although one of jerry 's theories about oliver stone was mildly amusing .
unfortunately , much of what 's discussed in the film is not inherently important to what 's going on , but instead filler that starts out with potential , but ends up just being extraneous because it 's never followed through .
for example , jerry professes that a man found drowned in his swimming pool was actually murdered by the government in a new york subway station .
he even goes so far as to explain that the station was flooded at the time due to a water main break ( hence the water in a subway station ) , and that the coroner should check the man 's lungs for chlorine .
this is convincing enough to alice that she seems to believe him .
you know what happens then ?
nothing , zip , nada .
no follow - up whatsoever , so what 's the significance ?
okay , here 's another one .
a couple of well known ( real life ) assassins were found to have possessed copies of the j .
d .
salinger novel "" the catcher in the rye "" .
jerry also has a bunch of copies .
whenever he goes into a bookstore , he has to buy one . leaving out the question of whether or not this makes jerry an assassin , we 're never given a reason to believe why this would make him an assassin .
not when we find out about his salinger collection , not when he goes to the bookstore , not later on when we get the answer to our first question .
the point becomes totally extraneous .
oh , did i mention that patrick stewart is in this film ?
yeah , he plays this government psychiatrist named dr .
jonas who may or may not be a bad guy .
that 's about it .
for all the presence this usually marvelous actor has , he 's nearly forgettable in conspiracy theory .
you can just lump him in with the supporting players , with the exception of cylk cozart who plays agent lowry of the fbi .
this guy was really likable , and i wish he and his character had gotten more screen time .
okay , here 's my theory .
this really started out as a great film , but some of its jokes were actually true !
the government came in and forced donner to make edits for the sake of national security , and this was what was left over .",0,"['one of the problems', 'slow pace', ""what happens then ? nothing , zip , nada . no follow - up whatsoever , so what 's the significance ?"", ""we 're treated to a few of the generic scenes"", ""the two just do n't click"", 'the rest of the film seems to be a lot of boredom', 'dialog is undistinguished and rather unmemorable , to the point that i almost stopped listening', ""he 's nearly forgettable"", 'the script in general also seems forced']"
"it seemed wholly appropriate that at a weekend screening of "" the horse whisperer , "" the start of the film was delayed some twenty minutes due to "" projection difficulties .
""
robert redford 's film version of nicholas evans ' best - selling novel was supposed to have been in theaters last december , going head - to - head with "" titanic , "" but is only now making its much anticipated debut .
this ( strategic ? )
delay has allowed "" the horse whisperer "" to compete , sans fanfare , against some smaller , unassuming movies during a relatively slower time at the box office .
no matter .
redford 's film stands head and shoulders above james cameron 's ocean - going tragedy , especially in the writing and acting departments .
whatever the reasons for its postponement , "" the horse whisperer "" supports the old adage "" better late than never .
""
redford has taken evans ' book and given it the big screen treatment .
while parts of "" the horse whisperer "" are epic in scope and vision , especially the aerial "" travelogue "" that maps out this great country of ours , its real strength lies in the subtleties it uses to paint the fragile alliance between man and beast .
when her daughter , grace , is involved in a terrible riding accident , hard - driven fashion editor annie maclean ( kristin scott thomas ) devotes herself to rehabilitating both grace and grace 's beloved horse , pilgrim . refusing to have the hideously disfigured animal put down , annie researches every possible source of information about equine cures before discovering an article about a faith - healing cowboy of sorts called tom booker ( redford ) , who has a way with horses and , perhaps , with people too .
undeterred by tom 's initial reluctance to get involved , annie drives grace and a sedated pilgrim across country to meet him , and finally persuades tom to work with the uncontrollable animal .
redford 's film unfolds slowly and lovingly , echoing the patience required in healing both physical and psychological wounds .
the film 's a little long and , even if you have n't read the book , it 's pretty obvious where it 's heading -- but these are minor complaints .
redford and thomas are strong and convincing
as the couple drawn by a mutual affection for the great outdoors and each other ,
but it 's scarlett johansson as grace who shines in a more difficult role .
dianne wiest , chris cooper ( "" lone star "" ) , and sam neill -- better than i 've seen him before -- round out the respectable supporting cast .
and the director 's respect for horses is clearly in evidence .
one word of warning , however : while brilliantly shot
, the accident scene , involving an out - of - control truck , is extremely disturbing .
redford 's canvas is huge and exquisite .
he does n't hesitate to incorporate vast , sprawling vistas of the american northwest : spectacular , snow - capped mountain ranges , azure skies , and shimmering fields of wheat -- all are resplendent in cinematographer robert richardson 's viewfinder .
veteran english composer john barry was originally signed to score the film but left the project which is a pity , since "" the horse whisperer "" is "" dances with wolves "" by way of "" out of africa "" ( oscar winners both for barry ) .
fortunately , barry 's replacement , thomas newman , contributes a fine score that nicely balances
the majesty of montana with the delicate , human conditions -- sonorous , string - laden passages that swell with pride playing counterpoint to more poetic , introspective movements ripe with nuance .

"hollywood has a . 750 batting average with elmore leonard adaptations .
last year 's touch was ill - conceived and just plain odd but get shorty , jackie brown and
now out of sight all were highly entertaining movies .
steven soderburgh , master of sex , lies and videotape , now adds crime to his repertoire in this tale of bank robbery , prison , double - crossing , uncut diamonds and ,
oh yeah , true love .
george clooney is the protagonist , a risky choice after such duds as batman and robin and the peacemaker , but for once i did n't want to slap the taste out of his mouth .
he plays his role in out of sight as the suave cary grant - type perfected in hitchcock movies , the kind of guy to whom crime is just a profession like any other .
nowhere present is clooney 's usual ain't - i - sexy sneer -- there 's just enough leftover lightheartedness to fit in with the leonard style .
clooney is definitely a perfect successor to john travolta in get shorty .
clooney plays a man who 's robbed about 200 banks without ever using a gun .
in the opening scene , he walks into one bank and robs it not only with ease but with charm .
of course , he gets caught , so it 's not all good .
it 's while doing time in a florida prison that clooney learns of one rich inmate 's ( albert brooks in a frightful bald wig ) collection of diamonds in detroit .
clooney and cohort ving rhames plan the score , while protection artist and fight promoter don cheadle begins rival plans .
meanwhile , there 's jennifer lopez .
unintentionally funny in selena and intentionally funny in anaconda , she 's finally graduated to a worthy role as the u . s .
marshal who happens to be driving up to the jail on the night clooney escapes .
rhames is waiting to give him a ride in a stolen car , and lopez makes it a threesome , her hostage ass locked in a trunk with clooney .
he 's covered in dirt and has a gun to her neck , and it 's a little cramped in there , but they manage to make a love connection anyway , probably because it 's a movie .
the relationship between clooney and lopez is at the heart of the movie , and one of the details that elevates it beyond your normal noir - ish crime story .
the leonard movies are more obsessed with dialogue than crime , and this is no exception .
although they 're not really germane to the plot , lopez 's relationship with her father ( dennis farina of get shorty ) , rhames ' relationship with his christian sister ( you could call her sister christian ) and a pop - in cameo by michael keaton
all lend extra class to a movie already full of it .
out of sight spans at least three years but has a non - linear structure , focusing on the jailbreak / brooks score and flashing back to earlier times .
this is a movie with a brain , as smooth and calculated
as the clooney and lopez characters themselves .
the entire cast does the material justice -- clooney and lopez coming into their own , and rhames and cheadle cementing their positions as two of my favorites .
here 's hoping future leonard adaptations continue to carry the torch .
serving america for almost 1/20th of a century !",1,"['cementing their positions as two of my favorites', 'definitely a perfect successor', 'all lend extra class to a movie already full of it', 'smooth and calculated', 'coming into their own', 'a movie with a brain']"
"it 's an interesting premise .
our reality is only real to us because it is what we perceive to be real .
in truth , our entire existences are lived out in our minds as we are fed information through electronic inputs directly to our brains .
what we see , what we do , everything around us is nothing more than a computer - generated construct interlinked with the minds of others through a vastly powerful artificial intelligence .
our bodies , severely atrophied , are kept alive for the sole purpose of generating heat and electrical energy for a dominating order of machines which control the planet .
the sci - fi realm has been waiting a little while for something new to come along .
the matrix is n't it - the idea of a war between man and a sentient computer network , a sham world , the ability to plug one 's brain into a computer , has all been gleaned from such sources as the terminator , dark city , and a few star trek episodes ( both classic and next generation ) .
what is new is the ability to weave all of these various elements together and succeed in producing a film that is both entertaining as well as thought - provoking .
keanu reeves plays a computer whiz nicknamed neo , who is plucked out of the artificial world ( known as the matrix ) by a group of renegade humans who are clandestinely fighting to expose the fallacy of the computer - generated existence and free humankind from the oppression of the machines .
the group 's leader , morpheus ( laurence fishburne ) , has chosen neo because he believes neo is "" the one "" who is destined to lead the attack against the artificial intelligence .
> from the beginning of the film , we are kept on our toes trying to figure things out .
this , in a lesser movie would be annoying , but the matrix presents itself in an intelligent manner which makes the puzzle rather interesting and even fun .
what is reality ?
what is a sham ?
the film turns our very perception of life on its side .
more than once , we are also presented with the question of whether we would rather know the harsh truth of reality , or live a life of relative bliss , oblivious to the true nature of our surroundings . as viewers ,
this is intriguing enough , so imagine what it would be like for neo .
and who to better play a bewildered person than keanu reeves ?
reeves , whom i 've never really cared for as an actor , is competent in roles which require a lot of straightforwardness , and little subtlety .
he was good in speed , for example , but laughably poor in a walk in the clouds .
neo is actually one of those roles which reeves
slips into rather nicely
, so much of my expectation was happily for naught .
in a couple of places , the script even capitalizes upon his wooden nature , and this is a heavy credit to writers / directors andy and larry wachowski .
i mean , since bill and ted 's excellent adventure , what movie could you say really "" utilized "" keanu reeves ?
more interesting than reeves is fishburne , who 's morpheus nearly runs the gamut of emotions , and convincingly so . very surprising for a sci - fi movie .
fishburne also maintains a certain demeanor about himself throughout , as if he always knows what to expect .
this helps to further the aura of his character 's proficiency and extensive knowledge .
hugo weaving as agent smith , one of the artificial intelligence 's anti - intruder programs , is also good playing his deadpan , no - nonsense , kick ass role , which requires him to show emotion at the appropriate time .
unfortunately , when weaving speaks for more than a few sentences in a row , the nature of his character 's speech pattern becomes a little more laughable than impressive .
carrie - anne moss plays trinity , morpheus 's number one assistant who becomes somewhat of a love interest for neo .
although her character is somewhat inconsistent , moss
nevertheless delivers an above par performance when fishburne is n't in the picture .
there were few expenses spared when it comes to the special effects .
many methods of imagery are employed , from modeling to bluescreen to computer graphics .
of special note is the use of the "" freeze and turn "" effect where the entire scene is frozen , turned , then continued from a new angle .
this is accomplished by using a large number of still cameras employed in a semi - circle , with motion picture cameras placed at the two ends .
the motion cameras film the action , and at the appropriate moment all the still cameras fire at once .
place each still image in a film sequence
and you get a nearly seamless transition from the first motion camera to the second .
pretty slick .
the matrix drips with style .
from the clothing to the music to the action , we 're watching an exaggerated version of what we 're used to .
much of it seems like the combination of two genres of the hong kong action film - there 's a lot of kung fu , there 's a lot of gunplay .
when a character is letting go with an automatic weapon , much is made of the empty cartridges falling to the floor in slow motion .
there 's also the element of the japanese action cartoon ( called anime by aficionados ) , especially in the way the sequences are filmed in sweeping pans and emphasized actions through special effects .
combined ,
it 's really like no live - action film i have ever seen .
the film is not without its faults .
some of the scenes and ideas are "" borrowed "" a little too liberally from other films , and one component of the ending is decidedly disappointing .
some of the lines are also pretty bad - in one instance , a supporting character incorrectly delivers a famous saying , and it was n't meant to be a joke .
however , these shortcomings detract little from what is an overall solid action sci - fi film that for once does more than merely entertain .",1,"['we are kept on our toes', 'presents itself in an intelligent manner which makes the puzzle rather interesting and even fun', 'competent', 'an overall solid action sci - fi film that for once does more than merely entertain', 'is also good', 'what is new is the ability to weave all of these various elements together and succeed in producing a film that is both entertaining as well as thought - provoking', 'this is intriguing enough', 'turns our very perception of life on its side', ""it 's an interesting premise"", 'pretty slick', 'slips into rather nicely', 'nevertheless delivers an above par performance', ""it 's really like no live - action film i have ever seen"", 'drips with style', ""this helps to further the aura of his character 's proficiency and extensive knowledge"", 'more interesting', 'convincingly']"
"my friend here in film school just made a two minute - long film for one of his classes that includes a staged anal rape scene , done by two guys and shot on the shadow of the incident , with a banana being used as the instrument of penetration . as sick as this all is , watching it is one of the most admittingly hysterical moments i 've ever witnessed .
sure , it may be in bad taste , but what the hell is bad taste other than something that may be offensive to some but is riotously amusing to the rest ?
then there 's "" caligula .
""
this film features incest , necrophilia , beastuality , anal rape , homosexual felatio of both sexes , elaborate and lengthy orgies , a greased - up fist forced up a man 's rear , wine poured down a man who 's had his urinary tracts tied off , a penis chopped off and fed to hungry dogs , etc , etc , etc .
this could very well be a respectable film , and if could have been had
the following not occurred : a ) the events were graphically shot in clear view ; b ) the tone was not that of trying to shock comically but to , well , show "" historical accuracy ; "" c ) the film was a 20 million dollar production with lavish sets , a rather impressive cast , and a whopping 2 1/2 hour running time .
produced and funded by none other than bob guccione , owner of penthouse magazine , "" caligula "" comes across as the most hysterical dramatic picture since "" plan 9 from outer space "" because underneath there 's a sense that everything this film is doing is not only accurate and justified , but also brilliantly entertaining .
after all , it 's not really the fact that this film features the aforementioned disgusting moments , but that it actually believes in them as dramatic weaponry .
no film should be discarded because its content , because film is never about what it 's about , it 's about how it 's about ( as the old cliche goes ) .
those who bash this film for content are glancing over the biggest and most obvious problem with "" caligula , "" and that 's that
it 's nothing but overdramaticized bullshit from start to finish , without a second of credibility in its mammoth running time .
"" caligula "" allegedly tells the true story of the evil roman emporer of the same name , a man who was so insanely decadent that his assasination came as a blessing . . .
or so i guess , even though almost every single roman emporer was assasinated as well and for much the same reasons .
the film opens on the wrong note
, of course , with a quote from mark appearing before any image graces the screen , using the over - used passage "" what shall it profit a man if he should gain the whole world an dlose his own soul , "" depite the fact that the opening scene of the film is of the emporer before he was an emporer , fucking around with his own sister in a field ( i suppose if one has to lose their soul , one has to have a soul in the first place ) .
the plot is so incomprehensibly done that all i or anyone else can make out of it is that caligula ( disastrously played by the great malcom mcdowell , a performance that does the opposite that his performance in "" a clockwork orange "" did ) is next in line for the throne but ca n't wait for the current emporer , tiberius ( peter o ' toole - ditto , only for his performance in "" lawrence of arabia "" ) , his grandfather , to die .
. .
so he kills him and ascends to the throne .
then he abuses his position , marries a woman ( helen mirren , who retains her dignity as an actor by not exactly acting )
so he does n't just have to sleep with his sister ( a dreadful teresa ann savoy , there to be pretty , naked , and willing to hop in the sack with mac or anyone he asks her to hop in with ) , abuses his position a little more , a little more , and a little more , and then , i believe , invades england
, then is killed off .
the filler , instead of recounting his life , is supposed to be , as guccione claims , the ultimate portrait of decadent pagan rome , complete with orgies , vicious deaths , and lots of nudity .
but instead of being the historical accurate film it really really wants to be , it instead becomes guccione 's twisted masturbatory image of what it could be like .
oh , is n't it great that they just loved having sex ? and that they killed people so disgustingly ?
and would n't it be great if i could make a couple bucks by selling this shit off as accuracy even though it 's so blatantly real bad porn that i 've completely convinced myself that it 's not .
i mean , why not just show a roman orgy when i can spend a good ten minutes examining every single facet that makes it up .
and it 's not just that it 's disgusting or vile or
whatever adjective you want to use to describe this film - it 's that in a film where the entire feel it 's going for is n't felt ,
it 's also the sloppiest expensive movie of all time .
the sets are lavish , but so blatantly innacurate that i wonder if no historian wanting to have his name on this film explains this .
but that does n't matter since the cinematography is so dark that you wonder if a light meter was used at all , making this not only dark and ugly , but just plain dark .
the camera operation is also the worst i 've ever seen in my entire life .
not only does this film hold the record for the most unnecessary zooms in one single shot ever , but often the camera will lose its subjects and pan around till they find them , then have them out of focus .
the editing is so sloppy that some scenes are absolutely impossible to follow .
there is no writer to speak of (
what the hell does it mean that it 's "" adapted from an original screenplay by gore vidal ? "" ) , but nevertheless , the dialogue is shit , so laughably bad that i ca n't in good faith believe that anyone with an iq over 5 could say them with a straight face ( my favorite being the line when caligula inquires the doctor about the health of the dying tiberius : "" he could go at any moment , but with care , he could last a year or so .
"" ) the music in this film is mostly prokofiev and khachaturian ( they use his gorgeous "" adagio of spartacus and phrygia , "" ad nauseum ) , used in an attempt to give the film some emotion , but instead feels as if it was shipped in from elsewhere .
the orgy scenes ( and one infamous lesbo scene between penthouse pets lori wagner and aneeka dilorenzo ) are the result of reshoots by guccione himself , which are so obviously removed from everything else in this film that it only adds to the embrassment ( every five seconds or so , the film cuts to random nudity , as if it was afraid its audience would forget this film is rated "" x "" ) .
john gielgud represents the only voice of sanity , walking around in his brief role as if he was constantly the mantra , "" i 'm going to kill my agent , i 'm going to kill my agent . . .
""
and so on and so on , for over 2 1/2 hours , making "" caligula
"" about as exciting and enriching as a three hour college lecture class and twice as deliriously annoying . guccione , in his pursuit of historical accuracy has instead made a film that is such a painstaking , arduous task to watch in its entirety that i doubt anyone can sit through an hour of it without irreversible psychological damage .
throughout the entire film , the presence of guccione is easily felt , as if he were standing there at the edge of the screen , pretentiously looking down upon us saying "" look what i can get away with !
and if you do n't like this , then you 're a prig , and worse than that , you know nothing about history !
""
uh huh . there 's a clear difference between historical accuracy and doing something that 's artistically good .
a film which showed roman decadence as something that was perhaps liberating for some but could not last - that would probably make for a good film .
but using historical accuracy as a licence to get away with any kind of disgusting - for - disgustingness'-sake acts is total , total bullshit
, and all i can say is that guccione and the makers of this film have lost any kind of touch with either entertainment or eroticism , and have developed a pathetic and sadistic taste for both , judging from this film .
there 's a film that came out in 1989 called "" the cook , the thief , his wife , and her lover , "" a magnifcent film by legendary cult director peter greenaway ( also starring helen mirren ) , which deals with graphic sex , heartstopping violence and gore , and even a little cannibalism for good measure .
that film not only never patronized its viewers , but also handled them in a way that was shocking , yes , but also , in a bizarre way , entertaining and totally involving .
there were real characters there in a real situation , and best of all passion and just the right amount of restraint as not to get off on the fact that it 's going to be offensive to many .
that film achieved everything it wanted to do , and has since retained a status as one of those cult films that is not only popular but actualy good .
and it 's everything "" caligula

"i have nothing against unabashedly romantic films .
when done right , with at least slightly evident restraint , they can be engaging , sweeping , appealing .
but it 's a hell of a shame when someone botches it as badly as nora ephron botched sleepless in seattle ,
a hollow , boring romance that should appeal only to the most gullible of viewers ; the ones willing to buy into ephron 's whiny views of life and romance .
tom hanks and meg ryan , two of hollywood 's most likeable stars play sam baldwin and annie reed , repectively .
baldwin 's wife recently died and he moved to seattle with his son , jonah , seeking to get away from the familiar surroundings which remind him of his late spouse .
jonah senses tension and calls a talk radio show to tell the world about their problems .
sam seems ready to strangle his son for calling the show , but when he gets on the phone he begins pouring his heart out .
ephron has him do this so that annie reed ( meg ryan ) can hear it .
annie is a happy woman .
she is engaged to walter , an allergy - prone working man and seems to be perfectly content .
but after hearing sam the widower on the radio show , she becomes convinced that he is her destiny and is willing to risk her engagement for it .
five years after this movie hit theaters , hanks , ryan and ephron would team up again in the far better , although still sub - par romantic comedy you 've got mail , which is about people who hate each other in real life falling in love on the internet .
at least that movie had a sense of spontaneity .
here it seems that the first one hundred minutes exist solely to set up for the last five .
the fact that sam and annie will finally meet is so excruciatingly obvious that everything else is perfunctory .
sleepless in seattle is full of wonderful performers ; from its two leads to supporting stars like bill pullman and rosie o'donnell . but none of them can save the film from being a bore .
its characters are dull and empty , its script is n't funny or particularly charming .
the script has a fundamental problem : annie gives up , for little reason , her life with walter to pursue "" sleepless in seattle , "" whom she has never even seen .
it 's the kind of life decision that real people do n't make , and its a major , unforgivable plausibility sacrifice .
in essence , this movie 's purpose is to head towards a goal that should n't even exist .
it 's a ten minute short film with ninety - five minutes of filler .

"waiting at the train station near the beginning of fury , joe says : ` after all , we 're human . '
in the context of events to transpire , joe 's line is prophetic , foreshadowing the internal conflict of the protagonist in the latter half of the film .
does being human necessarily imply humane behavior ?
through the baseness of human character exemplified in the formation of a mob , fritz lang prompts the viewer to consider whether our inclination towards impulsiveness supersedes our civility . expressing his abhorrence towards the rise of nazism in his homeland , lang takes great care in creating a sense of discomfort during the scenes of mob hysteria .
in the scene prefacing the lynching , the mob achieves critical mass at the bar .
deputy meyers is brought in as an exalted informant , but when he is unable to augment the mob 's myth of joe , he is quickly renounced from his position as town gossip .
we see in a shot where two bar patrons are arguing that the deputy looks around nervously at the growing monster and then carefully slips out of the bar .
what is quietly horrifying is the realization by both the audience and the deputy that the crowd no longer exists within the confines of reason and has succumbed to what the barber referred to as impulse .
what once was excitement to the deputy has turned into fear with the realization that he is now powerless .
to the audience , the deputy 's quiet exit concurs with their own sinking feeling of uneasiness as the mob 's delirium crescendos .
lang educes this discomfort not through movement of the camera , but rather its stillness .
the shot 's composition places the audience equidistant and directly across from the pair of arguing patrons and the deputy effectively becomes a mirror to our own apprehensions .
as the intensity of the mob closes around deputy meyers , it does so around the viewer as well .
the stationary camera in this shot heightens our fears because when the deputy escapes , we are deserted by our reflection and the viewer becomes the sole proprietor of sensibility amongst a swarm of irrationality .
because the camera does not track the deputy 's movement , we are left with an amplified perception of desertion and vulnerability .
as the bar scene progresses , the camera pans 180 degrees to reveal the fury of the mob .
this shot is unique because it is a point - of - view shot where the audience , not a character in the film is the subject .
while a long , or dolly shot may objectively reveal the size of the mob , panning from the mob 's belly distorts the audience 's spatial reference and exaggerates the claustrophobia of the scene ; we feel we are at the epicenter of something infinitely large .
we see close shots of people 's faces , contorted by their rage .
with the pivot of the pan being in the center of the mob and angry members within a short radius of the pan , lang offers the viewer a sense of what it feels like to be the subject of a lynching .
in this shot the audience is at the mercy of the mob ; lang 's camera makes us feel vulnerable and powerless as joe must have felt in the jail .
in some greater sense , it must have been what lang felt when he saw his countrymen overcome with unjustifiable hatred towards their own humankind .
lang 's observations of his fellow man succumbing to mob behavior left him with an indelible image of malevolent human behavior .
as joe faces his peril , trapped in his burning cell , his dog rainbow rushes to be by his side .
lang makes rainbow a martyr to contrast his humanity against the recklessness of his human counterparts .
using his camera to create shots that elicit disturbing images of mob mentality , lang depicts man 's volatility and ` impulse ' towards inconceivable cruelty .
reprising joe ' s line at the train station
, we are induced to question why our primeval impulses so easily transcend our humanity .",1,"['this shot is unique', 'takes great care in creating']"

"one of the most popular subplots in the entire science fiction genre is time travel .
that concept , although many purists doubt its scientific credentials , spawned many interesting novels , comic books and films in the last century .
however , the big grand - daddy of time travels , h .
g .
wells ' novel the time machine , was n't written with the intention to speculate about that concept or its consequences .
the author , h .
g .
wells merely used it as a convenient way to express his socialist views and condemn the great social gap between the rich , idle capitalist class and impoverished labour .
whatever intentions wells had , the future generations of readers were less impressed by his political messages .
instead they were fascinated by the idea that the strange new worlds could be explored without traveling trough space .
the novel became one of great classics of science fiction genre and it natural for filmmakers to use it as inspiration .
first of them was george pal , who in 1960 directed film which would , through the years , become genre classic of its own .
the plot revolves about george ( rod taylor ) , victorian scientist who discovered the way to travel through the fourth dimension - time .
at the eve of the new 20th century , george gathers his friends in order to present them his invention - machine that would enable him to travel through time .
they are skeptical , but that does n't prevent george from carrying out his plan and traveling into the future .
at first , he travels slowly , seeing london as it changes through the years and three world wars .
finally , after witnessing world war three , he travels far into the future , hoping that he would cease to witness wars and senseless destructions .
when he finally reaches year 802 , 701 ad , at first glance , new world looks like utopia - humanity consists of young , beautiful , but idle eloi , people who are fed , clothed and taken care of by unseen machines .
but , weena ( yvette mimieux ) , eloi woman , tells george about another side of the coin - in the night , her people is preyed upon by morlocs , humanoid creatures from the underworld .
the time machine became the cinematic classic for the very same reason the novel became the classic in science fiction literature - the fantastic concept was a brilliant way for the authors to talk about burning issues and fears of their respective times . for h .

it was frightening threat of class struggle ; for george pal and his screenwriter david duncan , who produced the film in the worst days of the cold war , it was the constant and more imminent threat of nuclear holocaust , underlined with the negative references to war throughout the movie .
even the modern audience , which would be tempted to discard the film as old - fashioned , could find some values in its universal messages , fit for each era .
compared with the genre films of today , the time machine is even better , and could serve as a good example how to make intelligent , thought - provoking films .
of course , since this is hollywood product after all , the time machine delivers such concepts in the form of classic adventure , sometimes sacrificing plausibility for the sake of attractiveness .
for example , it is hard to imagine that someone would be able to understand perfect english million years in future ; same is with morlocs degenerating into mutant monsters , while eloi remain undistinguished from the people of today .
some of the final scenes , that turn victorian scientist into an action superhero , are also rather unconvincing .
but , on the other hand , the film is very well directed , cleverly paced and the special effects , although definitely old - fashioned , are more than adequate for this kind of picture .
the acting is good , with rod taylor in one of his most remembered roles , while in the same time alan young brings rather memorable performance as george 's trusted friend filby .
yvette mimieux , who plays weena , on the other hand , would be remembered more by her looks than by the complexity of her role .
however , despite all those flaws , the time machine is a very good piece of cinema , something that connoisseurs of quality science - fiction films sorely miss these days .",1,"['is even better , and could serve as a good example how to make intelligent , thought - provoking films', 'could find some values in its universal messages', 'a very good piece of cinema', 'brings rather memorable performance', 'one of his most remembered roles', 'the cinematic classic', 'very well directed , cleverly paced', 'the acting is good', 'a brilliant way', 'more than adequate']"

the significant twist in the story is that spencer gets to go inside the cyborsuit , and the cyborsuit , nicknamed cy , has plenty of spunk .
cy keeps questioning the kid about everything including words like "" cool .
"" upon hearing that "" command , "" cy starts rapidly decreasing the temperature in the cyborsuit until spencer screams for him to stop .
and when cy speaks , we see spencer 's view , the backside of cy 's lips and eyes .
as 12-year - old spencer , joseph mazzello from the jurassic park film series gives a remarkably good performance as a wimpy and initially tongue - tied kid .
even when enclosed in his powerful new cyborsuit , he has his fears but he learns to overcome them .
""
if you run away , things do n't get better , whether it 's bullies , spiders , or girls , "" his science teacher advises him after he has difficulties dealing with all three .
turbo ( joey simmrin ) , the school 's chubby bully , beats up on him , spiders frighten him , and , most embarrassing of all , he ca n't speak when in the presence of his would - be girlfriend .
with his cyborsuit on , he learns some bravery that transcends his time inside cy .
spencer lives with his dad and his older teenage sister stacey , played by a smart - mouthed ashlee levitch , who looks like a younger sarah jessica parker .
stacey derides her brother , whom she barely tolerates , by referring to him only as "" the fungus .
""
this whole setup for spencer 's downtrodden and delightfully funny life makes his acquisition of some superhuman powers a source of mirth and empowerment .
the beauty of mazzello 's performance is that you can vicariously experience his fear and share in his enjoyment when he goes after the bully to teach him a lesson he 'll not soon forget .
the ensuing mayhem has some of the home alone antics , but the slapstick is kept tightly under control by writer and director manny coto so that one never feels embarrassed to be laughing .
the romantic angle is handled ever so delicately . when cy wishes to know if spencer wants to mate with the object of his desire , michelle ( lauren eckstrom ) , his eyes open wide in revulsion .
"" mate with her ! "" spencer exclaims .
"" pllllleeeeease , i just like her
that 's all .
""
the show has many funny twists .
in one , cy sees a man in a barney - like costume and begins firing at him , thinking he is an alien life - form .
soon things get way out of hand , and cy and spencer have to beat a hasty retreat .
as proof positive of the show 's class , it actually contains tasteful bathroom humor
-- thought that was an oxymoron in a kids ' picture , did n't you ?
cy can not allow spencer to leave the cyborsuit , and what happens when he needs to urinate becomes both sweet and hilarious .
the director 's staging of this sequence is one of the film 's more charming moments .
oh , and eating is pretty funny too .
spencer , whose idol is the comic book character "" midknight warrior , "" gets to face the challenge of a lifetime when a broodwarrior comes to capture the cyborsuit .
spencer 's valiant battle gives him a chance to find his mettle .
and the action sequences in the battle
manage to be quite respectable for a kids ' show full of inventiveness and lacking the usual repetition .
for a family movie mixing humor , fantasy , and action , star kid delivers .
although it 's probably not the sort of movie you 'd want to see without kids , with them
you 'll have a magical time with a relatively straightforward but well developed story
.
you 'll be rooting for and laughing with spencer and his buddy cy all the way through .
star kid runs 1 : 41 .
it is rated pg for fantasy combat .
although the basically cartoonish broodwarrior might scare the littlest kids , i saw none of this in evidence in our packed screening , so i would say the show is fine for kids five and up , and possibly the younger ones .
my son jeffrey , age 8 , got really excited about the picture .
he called it "" an especially good movie "" and gave it

"damn those trailers .
had it not been for the advertising of this film , which reveals far too much about its contents , i would have been glued to ` under the sand ' . as it is , the film retains some value , thanks to an excellent performance by charlotte rampling , and a more mature francois ozon in the director 's chair .
marie ( charlotte rampling ) and her husband jean ( bruno cremer ) lounge on the beach .
she takes a nap while he goes for a swim .
when marie wakes up , jean is nowhere to be found .
she contacts authorities , but they ca n't find him either .
did he disappear to start a new life ?
was he killed by accident ?
did he commit suicide ?
marie still asks herself these questions a year later , and in order to move on with her life , she must find some answers .
it 's a fine premise , and this little movie uses it to the limit .
the film moves at a leisurely pace , a bit slow , but relaxing .
it 's a very visual story , and you can pretty much just sit back without reading the subtitles .
this is mostly thanks to the excellent camera work
by antoine heberle and jeanne lapoirie , who shot the film in a dreamy haze , and the lead performance by rampling .
rampling is so expressive in her portrayal of marie , you connect with her character instantly , despite that she 's delusional .
the scenes where she interacts with her husband , who she still believes is alive , are heartbreaking .
she ca n't quite get over him .
they 've been married for twenty - five years .
the other actors , particularly jacques nolot , are excellent too .
the sex in the film is rather unneeded , but compared to ozon 's ` criminal lovers ' , it 's the disney channel .
likely to cause some discussion afterwards , ` under the sand ' is a fine movie going experience .
while it 's hard to recommend as entertainment , it 's a fine adult alternative about how we deal with loss .
ozon seems to ask what you would do , and that 's certainly a hard question to answer .",1,"['a more mature', 'so expressive in her portrayal', 'are excellent too', 'excellent camera work', 'is a fine movie going experience', 'heartbreaking', 'an excellent performance', 'a fine adult alternative']"
"are we victims of fate in life or can we create our own destiny ?
director / writer brad anderson seems to be saying yes to both questions in his witty film
""
next stop wonderland "" .
the two main characters , alan and erin , spend the entire movie in each other 's orbit , catching glimpses of one another , yet not quite connecting until the inevitable conclusion .
is it fate that keeps them near each other and ultimately puts them together ?
does this predestination carry over to all aspects of life ?
as the film starts , erin castleton ( hope davis ) , a melancholy 29- year old late shift nurse , is ending her live - in relationship with her boyfriend ( hoffman ) .
rather , he is ending it with her . arriving home from work , erin finds her boyfriend parked in front of their apartment , car packed with his belongings .
in a fumbling , amusing and self deluding ramble , he instructs erin to watch a videotape he 's made detailing why their relationship is doomed to fail and why he 's leaving .
it 's obvious he lacks the courage to confront her directly as he rails on about accomplishing something with his life and taking a stand , all the while backpedaling his way out of their relationship .
he then flees the scene with the grace of an inept thief .
erin 's mother ( holland taylor , in a surprisingly effective , small role ) , fearing that her daughter will be without a man in her life , takes out a personal ad for erin .
to erin 's embarrassed horror , the ad describes her as a "" frisky , cultured , carefree professional with a zest for life "" .
eventually , erin responds to the tidal wave of responses , which makes for some of the most humorous , telling moments of the movie as she meets prospective suitors and "" poseurs "" .
alan , a plumber and aspiring marine biologist , first spots erin as he 's cleaning the inside glass of a fish tank at the boston aquarium .
wearing a wet suit and goggles , he follows erin from window to window , separated by the glass as erin , oblivious to his gaze , enjoys the fish .
later , we see him on a train as she sits on a platform outside , mere feet away .
the movie spends it 's entirety having their paths circle each other without crossing .
there are several subplots involving alan .
one concerns his attempts to get on the job track at the boston aquarium , thereby escaping his apparent fate to carry on the family plumbing business .
another subplot involves his father 's desperate attempts to force fate 's hand by gambling away his life at the dog track .
a distracting focus is put on alan 's debt to a loan shark and the manner in which he pays it off .
the movie tries too hard to make alan a likable guy .
thankfully , his dream- guy persona is counterbalanced by erin 's distant , yet fundamentally hopeful , personality .
the film moves along at an unhurried pace , albeit too much so in the latter third , as we wait for the two to meet .
co - writers anderson and lyn vaus throw a couple of possible red herrings into the mix as the two find other possible relationships .
the films shifts into a much slower gear as we wait for these romances to blow over .
when alan and erin eventually do meet , we see that perhaps they both were destined for each other as they share a lingering , almost subliminally knowing , gaze .
it 's a sweet , measured moment .
the disappointment comes in the fact that we 've come to know the pair , yet we do n't get to view their impending romance .
the film 's inherent belief in the subtle persistence of fate and the wonder it can bring to one 's life makes "" next stop wonderland "" a quiet pleasure in a cinematic landscape littered with explosions , shallow characters and overdone special effects .",1,"['a quiet pleasure', 'the most humorous , telling moments of the movie', 'witty film', 'a surprisingly effective']"
"the american action film has been slowly drowning to death in a sea of asian wire - fu copycats .
it 's not a pretty death , and it 's leaving the likes of schwartznager , stallone , and van damme wearing cement galoshes at the bottom of a kung fu sea .
sometimes , the mix results in a mind - blowing spectacle unlike any other .
quality action with amazing and exciting stunt work , as in 1999 's the matrix , can be a real gem .
but too often hollywood gets it wrong , even when they pay off chinese directors .
flying ninjas and floating karate masters have been replaced by soaring bronx detectives and slow motion kicking scientists .
mostly it 's laughable .
in hollywood 's rush to emulate the success of the matrix , trademark asian stunt choreography has become more of a joke than an art form .
but iron monkey , the latest asian import , shows us how to get it right .
iron monkey ( actually a reissue of a 1993 film ) is the story of a 19th chinese vigilante ( rongguang yu ) , fighting with his own unique style of shaolin kung fu for the rights of the oppressed and the bellies of the hungry .
but it is also a piece of the narrative of legendary chinese film hero
wong fei - hong , most recently seen in one of the most overlooked , and possibly best films of 2000 , drunken master 2 ( released in the u . s . as the legend of drunken master ) .
unlike drunken master 2 , which stars jackie chan as an adult fei - hong , iron monkey finds a much younger fei - hong ( sze - man tsang ) and his father wong kei - ying ( yen chi dan ) thrust into the middle of iron monkey 's fight against oppression .
iron monkey succeeds as no kung fu film since drunken master 2 . at times , fighting styles , especially that of monkey himself , do devolve into the ridiculous twinkle - toed floating of films like crouching tiger , hidden dragon , director yuen wo ping eventually remembers to bring his action scenes back to earth .
iron monkey is at its heart a hardcore , kung fu action film rather than any kind of drama a la crouching tiger .
however , there are brief moments of profoundness shared between characters , such as those that pass between our outlaw hero and his good - hearted but misguided enemy , chief fox .
in those moments , and in others , iron monkey manages to transcend its mindless kung fu nature to touch the hearts and minds of its audience .
while in no way the equal of a masterpiece like drunken master 2 , iron monkey dances quite nicely to the invading kung fu tune .

"battlefield earth is the worst film of 2000 , and i guarantee you that nothing else this year will even come close .
in fact , i 'll be surprised if i see anything this bad in the next ten years .
based on the novel by scientology guru l . ron hubbard , battlefield earth begins and we immediately find out two pieces of key information .
it 's the year 3000 , and an alien race called the psychlos ( which sounds like a tag team of mexican wrestlers ) conquered our planet in nine minutes .
ok , we are all of 10 seconds in and i have a zillion questions racing through my mind .
when were we conquered ?
the audience is led to believe that this happened about 1 , 000 years earlier , and if that is the case then we 're going to get into a whole bunch of problems later ( trust me . . .
keep reading ) .
also , why do n't we get to see earth get conquered ?
how the hell do you make a popcorn sci - fi flick and not deliver the goods on the one event that sets up the film ?
humans now live as cavemen or slave labor , and for the film 's first act we focus on one particular cavemen group outside of denver , colorado .
they grunt and groan and babble about monsters .
so , when the psychlos conquered earth , were the only humans not captured a herd of newborn babies that crawled their way to safety in the hills ?
none of these characters have any knowledge of the planet being conquered ( whenever that was ) .
this is definitely not the way to start an action / sci - fi film .
one of the humans wanders out into the wilderness and stumbles across what he thinks is a monster , and he begins to fight it .
the "" monster "" turns out to be a dinosaur from an old miniature golf course .
he turns around and sees all sorts of other characters from the golf course , with some shrubs growing over them .
so , in 1 , 000 years this stupid little golf course has stood the test of time , with only a few weeds growing over it ?
anyway , some of the humans are captured by the psychlos led by terl ( john travolta ) a smarmy and opportunistic alien planning on stealing a recently discovered gold deposit .
the cavemen ( led by barry pepper ) are forced to do their bidding or whatever , but eventually they gain the upper hand and reclaim the planet , or something .
so these cavemen are able to do what earth failed to do 1 , 000 years earlier ?
and , we 're supposed to believe that earth was conquered in nine minutes by a group of buffoonish aliens who ca n't even handle a few cavemen ?
one of the ways the humans reclaim the planet is by taking control of abandoned air force jets and using them to fight the psychlos .
so jets left unattended for 1 , 000 years are still able to fly ?
please , if i leave my car unattended for two weeks
i have to replace every fluid and hose under the hood .
why did the psychlos leave jets around anyway ?
should n't they have destroyed military installations during their massive nine minute campaign against us ?
the psychlos refer to humans as "" man animals "" but yet dogs are still "" dogs "" .
why are n't they "" dog animals "" ?
the psychlos are after mining earth 's precious resources , but for 1 , 000 years are unaware of fort knox ?
why do i even care at this point ?
i 'm a fan of travolta 's and i 'm glad to see he 's back on the a - list in hollywood ( despite the fact that he occasionally puts out crowd pleasing dreck like michael and phenomenon ) .
but how did he possibly think this was a good movie ? and how did he think he was giving a good performance here ?
he 's more than capable of making a menacing villain ( see broken arrow and face / off ) but whenever his character came on screen
i could n't hold back my laughter .
now despite the different facial features members of this alien race seem to have , travolta just looks like travolta .
all of the other aliens have weird foreheads or other pointy bones on their face , but travolta just has a goatee .
also , travolta 's acts with a sort of phony upper - class snooty accent and constantly whines about bureaucratic nonsense back on his home world .
ooooo , scary villain .
as a producer he should know better and as an actor he should definitely know better .
you can make a dumb but good sci - fi film ( i love independence day for example ) , but there is absolutely nothing entertaining about battlefield earth .
i did everything i possibly could to stay awake during the screening . . .
i cleaned my glasses , walked around the theater , made a grocery list , chose my lottery numbers for the week , replayed super bowl xxv in my head ( with commercials ) . . . and still was compelled to scrutinize the insides of my eyelids .
by the time we actually reach the year 3000 , people should still be avoiding this film .
folks , save your cash . .
do n't go see it , do n't rent it , and do n't buy it
.
you 'd be more entertained by taking the money you 'd use for this movie and just throwing it into the wind , watching it sail away ( hell , send it to us here at the jacksonville film journal .
. .
we 'll entertain you plenty with that kind of money ) .
unless of course you 're just captivated by countless slow motion shots of barry pepper running , which is just about all you 'll come away with from this movie .
that , and a headache .
[ editor 's note : for some reason though , the day after my screening i converted to scientology .
i 'm not sure why . . .
something just made me feel compelled make the choice . ]",0,"[""i could n't hold back my laughter"", 'phony upper - class snooty accent', 'was compelled to scrutinize the insides of my eyelids', 'the worst film of 2000', 'why do i even care at this point ?', ""save your cash . . do n't go see it , do n't rent it , and do n't buy it"", 'there is absolutely nothing entertaining', 'how did he possibly think this was a good movie ?', 'he should know better']"
"the premise of the new teen - targeted horror film ` final destination ' causes a recollection of a memorable ` simpsons ' halloween episode .
after attempting to repair a malfunctioning toaster , lovably ignorant patriarch homer realizes he has created a portable time - machine .
after a trek into the cretaceous period , homer observes that any minor alteration made there will erupt into a starling chain of events and seriously modify the present world .
again and again , homer toys with the master plan and pays dearly for it .
the characters of ` final destination ' have also tampered with the blueprint schematics of their existence - their ` design ' .
someone is after them with the strict intent of correcting the mistake .
that someone is death .
you see , alex browning ( devon sawa ) and six others have cheated the grim reaper . . . .
but the dude has got some tricks up his sleeve . for a high school excursion , alex 's french class is traveling to paris by airline transport .
alex , tense and neurotic , has a shocking premonition after boarding : he sees the plane , and every passenger on it , spontaneously explode in mid - air .
in a panic of sheer lunacy , alex charges his way through the aisle and demands removal from the aircraft .
after a handful of others ( including one teacher ) follow and are denied admittance back onto the plane ,
the unwitting ? survivors ' watch in horror as the plane actually explodes in the drizzling night sky .
the loony vision alex experiences does actually materialize .
but death wo n't be cheated so easily , and one by one , the survivors of flight 180 are offed in mysteriously gruesome circumstances .
the grisly murder count baffles the local officials and fbi .
before i delve into the meat of the review , i 'd just like to confer . . .
.
is that one helluva premise , or what ?
` final destination ' , creepy beyond rational comprehension , probably reads more like an unsettling ` x - files ' episode than ` the simpsons ' - therefore , the surprise is minimal when you discover the mutual creators behind both are glen morgan and james wong .
on familiar turf , the task of establishing footing is not difficult for morgan and wong , and the opening 20 minutes of ` final destination ' reflects that .
unlike most thrillers , the set - up is crisp and cool .
you just deeply , sincerely hope that the momentum wo n't unspool , leaving us with a second - string effort with nothing but cheap , derivative shocks .
young viewers have a palpable reason to expect this kind of formula deterioration , what with ` i know what you did last summer ' and sequel , ` idle hands ' and -- a movie with a nifty premise that just plunged like an anvil -- ` urban legend ' .
after the set - up , when i remained slouched apprehensively in my chair , i started to really have fun with ` final destination ' .
low and behold , a teen thriller that is actually unsettling , actually suspenseful and -- yes
-- actually intelligent .
some splotty logic and a heap of characteristic genre flaws aside , this film is among the most refreshing and all - out enjoyable horror movies to submerge since the cutting - edge ` scream ' in 1996 .
` final destination ' stimulates the nerves and offers a exhilarating retaliation strike against all the blood - spattered slasher crap we 've endured throughout the past few years .
not that the characters are that good .
sawa is game as alex , a connect - the - dots personality that we never fully comprehend .
in addition , the survivors are endearing geek tod ( chad e . donella ) , jocky control - freak carter ( kerr smith of ` dawson 's creek ' ) , carter 's ditzy girlfriend terry ( amanda detmer ) , the none - too - subtly named billy hitchcock ( seann william scott , supplier of lukewarm comic relief ) and a lone teacher - the emotionally delicate ms .
lewton ( kristin cloke ) .
aside from alex , the primary center of interest is intended to be ali larter ( ` varsity blues ' ) , playing an abstract character named clear rivers ( what were her parents thinking ? ! ? ) .
the personality of clear is written with such a vague , nebulous definition that she resembles a walking flash - card saying ` hello , i am the offbeat character designed to identify with the main character 's plight ! '
toss a few stereotypical fbi agents ( daniel roebuck and roger guenveur smith ) and a . . . .
ummm . . .
` spiritual ' mortician ( former ` candyman ' tony todd ) into the mix , and you have what could be another generic teenage frightfest with slicing , dicing and assorted disembowelments .
not so .
` final destination ' has no slicing and dicing , or at least none dealt by a human killer , and the thought of death itself as the unseen stalker is unique and frightening .
the extra dimension of disconcerting irony rejuvenates the decaying ? murderer - on - the - loose ' concept , with assistance from a shrewd , intelligently paced screenplay by morgan , wong and jeffrey reddick .
the plot twists are fun and clever without toppling into utter absurdity ( listen up , ` reindeer games ' ) .
but i suppose the most satisfying aspect of ` final destination ' is the murder scenes .
creative , resourceful and breathlessly inventive , the death sequences involve an unlikely string of events leading to a character 's demise .
what will trigger the accident ?
will it be the john denver record , just put on to play ` rocky mountain high ' ?
( yeah , sick humor ) .
will it be the leaking toilet ?
the falling fishing reel in the corner ?
the murders are startling and largely unforeseen , including one surprise incident that made the audience jump out of their seats and giggle nervously for roughly a minute afterward .
a sense of giddy unpredictability is added with this inventive approach .
it gets sorta tasteless and cheap sometimes , but who cares ?
it 's fun
.
in that simple regard , ` final destination ' is my cup of tea .
this stylishly executed thriller , although tagged with laughable circumstances and the occasional snippet of lame dialogue , is an immensely entertaining jaunt to the dark side .
after the show , it will also have an frightening impact on you .
when will your ? design ' expire ? is death waiting around the corner ?

"here 's a word analogy : amistad is to the lost world as schindler 's list is to jurassic park . in 1993 , after steven spielberg made the monster dino hit , many critics described schindler 's list as the director 's "" penance "" ( as if there was a need for him to apologize for making a crowd - pleasing blockbuster ) .
now , after a three - year layoff , spielberg is back with a vengeance .
once again , his summer release was special effects - loaded action / adventure flick with dinosaurs munching on human appetizers .
now , following his 1993 pattern , he has fashioned another serious , inspirational christmas release about the nature of humanity .
that film is amistad .
although not as masterful as schindler 's list , amistad is nevertheless a gripping motion picture . thematically rich , impeccably crafted , and intellectually stimulating , the only area where this movie falls a little short is in its emotional impact .
watching schindler 's list was a powerful , almost spiritual , experience .
spielberg pulled us into the narrative , absorbed us in the drama , then finally let us go , exhausted and shattered , three - plus hours later .
aspects of the movie have stayed with me ever since .
amistad , while
a fine example of film making , is not as transcendent .
the incident of the ship la amistad is not found in any history books , but , considering who writes the texts , that 's not a surprise .
however , the event is a part of the american social and legal fabric , and , while amistad does not adhere rigorously to the actual account , most of the basic facts are in order .
several , mostly minor changes have been made to enhance the film 's dramatic force .
on the whole , while amistad may not be faithful to all of the details of the situation , it is true to the spirit and meaning of what transpired .
one stormy night during the summer of 1839 , the 53 men imprisoned on the spanish slave ship la amistad escape .
led by the lion - hearted cinque ( djimon hounsou ) , they take control of the vessel , killing most of the crew .
adrift somewhere off the coast of cuba and uncertain how to make their way back to africa , they rely on the two surviving spaniards to navigate the eastward journey .
they are tricked , however , and the la amistad , which makes its way northward off the united states ' eastern coastline , is eventually captured by an american naval ship near connecticut .
the kidnapped africans are shackled and thrown into prison , charged with murder and piracy .
the first men to come to the africans ' defense are abolitionists theodore joadson ( morgan freeman ) and lewis tappan ( stellan skarsgard ) .
they are soon joined by roger baldwin ( matthew mcconaughey ) , a property attorney of little repute .
aided by advice from former president john quincy adams ( anthony hopkins ) , baldwin proves a more persuasive orator than anyone gave him credit for , and his central argument -- that the prisoners were illegally kidnapped free men , not property -- convinces the judge .
but powerful forces have aligned against baldwin 's cause .
current president martin van buren ( nigel hawthorne ) , eager to please southern voters and 11-year old queen isabella of spain ( anna paquin ) , begins pulling strings behind - the - scenes to ensure that none of the africans goes free .
at its heart , amistad is a tale of human courage .
cinque is a heroic figure whose spirit remains unbreakable regardless of the pain and indignity he is subjected to .
he is a free man , not a slave , and , while he recognizes that he may die as a result of his struggle , he will not give it up .
effectively portrayed by newcomer djimon hounsou , whose passion and screen presence arrest our attention , cinque is the key to viewers seeing the amistad africans as more than symbols in a battle of ideologies .
they are individuals , and our ability to make that distinction is crucial to the movie 's success .
to amplify this point , spielberg presents many scenes from the africans ' point - of - view , detailing their occasionally - humorous observations about some of the white man 's seemingly - strange "" rituals "" .
the larger struggle is , of course , one of defining humanity .
as the nazis felt justified in slaughtering jews because they viewed their victims as "" sub - human , "" so the pro - slavery forces of amistad use a similar defense .
the abolitionists regard the africans as men , but the slavers and their supporters see them as animals or property .
in a sense , the morality of slavery is on trial here with the specter of civil war , which would break out less than three decades later , looming over everything .
amistad 's presentation of the legal and political intricacies surrounding the trial are fascinating , making this movie one of the most engrossing courtroom dramas in recent history .
four claimants come forward against the africans : the state , which wants them tried for murder ; the queen of spain , who wants them handed over to her under the provision of an american / spanish treaty ; two american naval officers , who claim the right of high seas salvage ; and the two surviving spaniards from la amistad , who demand that their property be returned to them .
baldwin must counter all of these claims , while facing a challenge to his own preconceived notions as the result of a relationship he develops with cinque .
even though attorney and client are divided by a language barrier , they gradually learn to communicate .
aside from cinque , who is a fully - realized individual , characterization is spotty , but the acting is top - notch
.
matthew mcconaughey successfully overcomes his "" pretty boy "" image to become baldwin , but the lawyer is never particularly well - defined outside of his role in the la amistad case .
likewise , while morgan freeman and stellan skarsgard are effective as joadson and tappan , they are never anything more than "" abolitionists .
""
nigel hawthorne , who played the title character in the madness of king george , presents martin van buren as a spineless sycophant to whom justice means far less than winning an election .
finally , there 's anthony hopkins , whose towering portrayal of john quincy adams is as compelling as anything the great actor has recently done .
hopkins , who can convincingly play such diverse figures as a serial killer , an emotionally - crippled english butler , and richard nixon , makes us believe that he is adams .
his ten - minute speech about freedom and human values is unforgettable .
one point of difference worth noting between amistad and schindler 's list is this film 's lack of a well - defined human villain .
schindler 's list had
ralph fiennes ' superbly - realized amon goeth , who was not only a three - dimensional character , but a personification of all that the nazis stood for .
there is no such figure in amistad .
the villain is slavery , but an ideology , no matter how evil , is rarely the best adversary .
it is to spielberg 's credit that he has fashioned such a compelling motion picture without a prominent antagonist .
amistad 's trek to the screen , which encountered some choppy waters ( author barbara chase - riboud has cried plagiarism , a charge denied by the film makers ) , comes in the midst of an upsurge of interest in the incident .
an opera of the same name opened in chicago on november 29 , 1997 .
numerous books about the subject are showing up on bookstore shelves .
it remains to be seen how much longevity the amistad phenomena has , but one thing is certain -- with spielberg 's rousing , substantive film leading the way , the spotlight has now illuminated this chapter of american history .",1,"['the acting is top - notch', 'such a compelling motion picture', 'one of the most engrossing courtroom dramas in recent history', 'as compelling as anything the great actor has recently done', 'thematically rich , impeccably crafted , and intellectually stimulating', 'rousing , substantive film', 'a fine example of film making', 'a gripping motion picture']"
"melvin van peebles ' "" sweet sweetback 's baadasssss song "" was a watershed moment in the history of american cinema and the black movement .
it was released less than a decade after the civil rights movement had begun and almost twenty years before the rodney king incident .
its violent and highly sexualized revenge tale of a macho black hustler fighting back against white oppression and winning was something that had never been seen on an american movie screen before .
in style , content , and how it was conceived and produced , "" sweet sweetback "" was a cinematic revolution , whether or not one agrees with its subject matter .
van peebles , a black american who first gained recognition by writing novels in france , built "" sweet sweetback "" from the ground up almost entirely by himself .
because no studio would dare fund such a film , he was forced to raise all the money himself .
the movie ended up costing about $ 500 , 000 , part of which was put up by none other than bill cosby .
van peebles cut costs by hiring non - union labor and taking on most of the film 's responsibilities himself .
he wrote the script , scored the music , edited and directed the film , as well as starred in the central role .
he was also a brilliant entrepreneur who always found a way to make an extra buck .
for instance , when the mppa slapped the film with a dreaded x - rating , van peebles not only threatened to bring a lawsuit against jack valenti and the mpaa , but he also developed a little marketing scheme :
he coined the phrases "" rated x by an all - white jury , "" which he put on the movie posters to help advertise the film .
he also printed the phrase on tee - shirts which he had no problem selling .
the storyline in "" sweet sweetback "" is deceptively simple .
it takes place in los angeles , and van peebles stars as the title character , a tough male hustler of few words who grew up in a brothel , and makes money by doing what he does best : having sex .
one day , he agrees to go with a couple of amiable white cops down to the station to make it look like they 're bringing in suspects on a politically - charged case involving murder .
however , on the way to the station the cops arrest a young black revolutionary named mu - mu ( hubert scales ) , who they proceed to beat viciously .
acting out of complete impulse rather than political motivation , sweetback fights back and beats the cops to the brink of death .
the rest of the film follows sweetback as he evades the cops on his way to eventual escape in mexico .
although the repetition of watching sweetback run gets a little old by the end of the film , this plot allows van peebles ' camera to roam the darker side of l . a . - the ghettos , alleys , and back - street whorehouses that other films had always overlooked .
van peebles ' entire point in making the movie was to secure on celluloid a vision of the black experience in america that other filmmakers had ignored .
at the beginning of "" sweet sweetback , "" he offers this epigraph , which is a traditional prologue used in medieval times when a messenger brought bad news : "" sire , these lines are not an homage to brutality that the artist has invented , but a hymn from the mouth of reality . . .
""
van peebles wanted to make sure that his vision was one of reality , not of exaggeration .
of course , with today 's abundance of rap and hip hop music that sings the same ode to black inner - city life , as well as films by spike lee , john singleton , and the hughes brothers , "" sweet sweetback "" does n't seem all that revolutionary .
it is important to remember that this film must be viewed in the context and time period in which it was made .
at that time , "" sweet sweetback "" was so controversial that only two theaters in the entire united states would play it .
distributors were petrified of a film that , in van peebles ' words , gave the black audience "" a chance to see some of their own fantasies acted out - about rising out of the mud and kicking ass .
""
of course , once it caught on , it caught on big .
"" sweet sweetback "" is now considered to be the film that kicked off the blaxploitation era , although van peebles disassociates "" sweetback "" from other movies like "" shaft "" ( 1972 ) and "" the mack "" ( 1973 ) , because those were financed by big hollywood studios .
"" sweet sweetback "" is also the only film deemed mandatory viewing by the black panthers .
however , even if when viewed from an african - american perspective , "" sweet sweetback "" is certainly not without its controversies .
when it was first released , an article was published in "" ebony "" magazine denouncing the film , while at the same time the black panthers used an entire newsletter to praise it .
there have been arguments that the victory for sweetback is really no victory at all - beating cops and then running away to mexico is nothing to be proud of .
others have pointed out that sweetback has little to say throughout the film ; he has no political motivations , and therefore the violence and havoc he wreaks is not rooted in fundamental beliefs , but in personal and selfish motives .
still others point to the clich ?
black potency that stereotypes sweetback as being good at nothing but having sex , illustrated in a scene where he gains the respect of a white biker group by bringing their female leader to orgasm .
nevertheless , a movie like "" sweet sweetback "" can not be made without conflicting points of view .
it is a revolutionary movie
not because it 's about one man 's defiance , but because it put front - and - center black issues that had never been dealt with before .
until that point , american cinema was an almost exclusively white domain , and with the exception of sidney poitier , all black actors were relegated to specifically black roles that were important only in relation to whites .
the fact that "" sweet sweetback "" was a movie by black about blacks , was something new ( in the opening credits , van peebles lists the starring actors as simply "" the black community "" ) .
van peebles tells an interesting story
that goes a long way toward defining the difference between "" sweet sweetback "" and all movies that had come before it .
when the movie first opened , he saw it in a theater next to an older woman .
near the end of the film , when sweetback is wounded by the police and stumbling through the southern california desert , she kept saying to herself , "" oh lord , let him die .
do n't let them kill him .
let him die on his own .
""
it was so ingrained in her mind that death was imminent for any african - american in a movie who rebelled against white authority , that she could n't even conceive of the possibility that the film might end with his successful escape .
and , of course , sweetback does escape , and the screen fills with the message :
"" watch out !
a baad asssss nigger is coming back to collect some dues .
"" beyond the political aspects , "" sweet sweetback "" is an entertaining picture , which van peebles always intended it to be .
he squeezed every drop out of his limited budget , and produced a film that , although dated now , was technically fantastic at the time .
he shot in rough , documentary - like fashion , while also utilizing almost every visual and aural trick his technology would allow him .
he makes good use of older techniques like split screens , freeze frames , reversed color schemes , and overlapping images .
the only time the film ever looks bad is during the night sequences , because van peebles simply did not have the needed equipment .
watching "" sweet sweetback "" more than twenty - five years after its initial release , one realizes that it still has bite .
arguments can be made that race relations in the united states have made quantum leaps since the early seventies , but there are still problems that are reflected in this film .
but there is more to the film than its racial aspect .
the legacy of "" sweet sweetback 's baadasssss song "" is not only the plentiful amount of art and music told from the african - american perspective , but more importantly , the work of every artist who has fought to fund and produce that which is important to him .",1,"['a cinematic revolution', 'an entertaining picture', 'tells an interesting story', 'was technically fantastic at the time']"
"as the small boats rock slowly toward the shore at omaha beach normandy on d - day , the weary , seasick soldiers take a deep breath and open the large protective shield at the back of the boat .
they are unaware of exactly what is going to happen .
one man kisses the crucifix that hangs around his neck .
as the flap falls , the battle begins .
they are trapped like rats in a cage and proceed to be blown to pieces in the wake of enemy gunfire .
amid the chaos of this massacre , stands a shot that , at least for me , hangs in the air like the girl in the little red coat in schindler 's list .
a soldier , clearly missing an arm , wanders around the body - strewn beach like a lost puppy .
we are not invited to know what he is searching for until he finds it himself .
he bends over , picks up his arm and starts to carry it , probably not bothering to ask himself ; "" what now ? "" saving private ryan is a masterfully composed film .
the direction is out of this world , surely the type of command that can win spielberg another directing oscar .
the cinematography , by janusz kaminsky , is also astounding .
but be forewarned , this is the most violent and graphic film i have ever seen .
the articles you read and the warnings you see are justified ; saving private ryan is visually as disturbing as a film can get .
the question is , "" does the story and its realism justify the excessive use ?
"" the answer from my point of view is "" no "" .
braveheart was a truly gritty , and , one would imagine , realistic battle film .
ryan is ten times worse .
expect disembowelments , sucked in skulls , heads blown to bits , arms and legs flying across the battlefield .
many in the theater could not bear to watch .
and it is a shame , too , because this is otherwise by far one of the standouts this year .
but such graphic displays may turn away even the most loyal spielberg supporters ( and academy members ) . saving private ryan takes us from the attack at omaha beach on d - day , 1944 , through into the film 's primary mission .
captain miller ( hanks ) assembles an 8 man crew and sets off to find a missing solider , private ryan , whose three brothers have already been killed on the battlefield .
the government goes to great lengths to make sure that mrs .
ryan does n't recieve a fourth letter of condolences about her sons , that no person should suffer such injustice .
miller 's crew is not in favor of the mission and they begin to harbor a secret hatred for ryan , though they do n't yet know him .
they resent having to trudge out to bring home one soldier who does n't have any more or less right to live than any of them .
this film manages to keep up a rapid pace and , though there is a lot of set up between battles , the story continues full speed to the end .
the pacing and dramatism of the extremely well choreographed battle scenes is really in a league of it 's own .
spielberg , though not a student of the "" quick cut "" school of filmmaking , takes a stab at it here , and does it better than michael bay or any of his mtv counterparts could ever hope to do it .
bay should pay close attention , take copious notes .
if you want to jump cut every two seconds , do it the way spielberg does it in ryan .
in the end , the extremity of the gory violence is not justified by the "" importance "" of the film .
schindler 's list taught many people the truth about the holocaust .
it opened eyes , sparked debate and study .
though the battle scenes in ryan have never been portrayed as realistically before , they do n't amount to anything as serious or thought provoking as the schindler 's list .
overall , this is just the truest depiction of the old adage , "" war is hell .
"" but braveheart - dosage would have fit this movie much more appropriately , and would have made the difference between me getting up the nerve to see it again some day and realizing that this is something i doubt i could endure again .

"here 's something to chew on : what 's the favorite food of big , cheesy - looking special effects monsters
like the one lurking in the bowels of a luxury liner in deep rising ?
the obvious answer to this question is cardboard , because that 's the depth of the most fully- developed character in this painfully generic creature feature .
deep rising demonstrates all the originality and vitality of something scripted by a computer .
in fact , considering the rigid adherence to the expected formulas , perhaps it was .
the most astonishing thing about deep rising is the exceptionally high level of gore .
not since starship troopers have this many chunks of flesh ( both human and non - human ) been scattered in all directions .
we learn some bloody trivia , as well , such as how a sea monster spraypaints in red ( it drinks a human being then spits out the liquefied remains ) and what it does with half - digested leftovers .
i suppose deep rising 's gallery of grotesque images represents fun stuff for those who love the macabre , but it does n't do much for me .
on the surface , and that 's about the only level at which this film can be analyzed , deep rising feels like tremors grafted onto titanic ( everyone else is citing the equally valid aliens / titanic connection , since james cameron directed both ) .
in going for the big disaster angle of titanic and the tongue - in - cheek mayhem of tremors , deep rising somehow misses both marks by a wide margin .
the film is not humorous , tense , or exciting .
in fact , it 's downright boring , and , despite being half the length of cameron 's current box - office champ , deep rising feels like the longer movie .
is it really necessary to say anything about the plot ?
probably not , since it 's easy to guess ,
but i 'll go ahead and oblige anyone who wants a synopsis .
the film opens by introducing us to a gang of bad guys on board a mercenary ship .
in addition to the usual cast of psychopaths and lunatics , there 's finnegan ( treat williams ) , the boat 's pilot , who 's supposed to be an indiana jones knockoff ; joey ( kevin
j .
o'connor ) , the inept sidekick who 's supposed to be lovable and funny ( but is really just irritating ) ; and hanover ( wes studi ) , the "" mastermind "" ( and i use that term lightly ) of the operation .
their goal : attack a cruise ship , clean out the safe , then sink it using some illegally - acquired torpedoes .
the problem is , by the time they reach the argonautica , the titanic - like luxury liner has turned into the marie celeste .
aside from a beautiful jewel thief ( famke janssen ) and a couple of crew members , there 's no one on board .
the reason soon becomes obvious -- the ship has been taken over by a bad special effect that is supposed to resemble an octopus with teeth and more than eight tentacles .
the cast , which is led by treat williams , is primarily comprised of has - beens and probably - never - will - bes ( two exceptions : wes studi , best known as the villain in the last of the mohicans , and djimon hounsou , amistad 's cinque ) .
williams , once a "" ca n't miss "" prospect in hollywood , has fallen so far out of favor
that the best he can do these days for a lead role is a film like deep rising , and his inability to create a charismatic or interesting figure here may sink whatever is left of his sputtering career .
famke janssen , who will forever be known as xenia onatopp from goldeneye , is the perfect bland match for williams .
given her limited acting abilities , it 's likely that she was chosen for this part primarily on the basis of her physical attributes .
unfortunately , a bra defeats the purpose of having her in a wet tee - shirt for half of the picture .
meanwhile , kevin j .
o'connor , who has entirely too much screen time , exhibits all the appeal of fingernails scratching a blackboard .
these days , audiences are becoming more difficult to impress with computer - generated special effects .
this is a lesson that writer / director stephen sommers ( who previously helmed the live - action jungle book ) needs to learn .
the days of jurassic park , when viewers were astounded by the mere spectacle of seeing something big and imposing on screen , are past .
now , movie - goers are looking for the sophistication of titanic -- visuals that are so well - incorporated that it 's impossible to tell where they end and where "" reality "" begins .
in deep rising , the monster , like everything , is artificial and unconvincing .
unfortunately , the fundamental problem audiences are faced with here is n't so much the idiotic monotony of this individual picture , but the poor quality of the entire bankrupt genre
( although , to be fair , deep rising is a particularly bad entry ) .
even once this film has sunk out of sight , the knowledgeable viewer knows it wo n't be the last of its kind .
like the slimy , slithering things that inhabit the air vents and pipes of these movies , more are waiting just around the corner in ambush .
and that consideration , unlike anything on screen , is truly horrifying .",0,"['rigid adherence to the expected formulas', 'inability to create a charismatic or interesting figure here may sink whatever is left of his sputtering career', 'is primarily comprised of has - beens and probably - never - will - bes', 'limited acting abilities', 'fallen so far out of favor', 'slimy , slithering things that inhabit the air vents and pipes of these movies', 'is a particularly bad entry', 'big , cheesy - looking special effects monsters', 'has entirely too much screen time , exhibits all the appeal of fingernails scratching a blackboard', 'painfully generic', ""somehow misses both marks by a wide margin . the film is not humorous , tense , or exciting . in fact , it 's downright boring"", ""artificial and unconvincing . unfortunately , the fundamental problem audiences are faced with here is n't so much the idiotic monotony of this individual picture , but the poor quality of the entire bankrupt genre""]"

now , more than 20 similarly - themed pictures later , jesse james and his notorious gang of outlaws ride again in a banal mtv spin on an american legend .
the story begins as jesse ( charasmatic colin farrell ) and his brother frank ( gabriel macht ) , cole and scott younger ( scott caan , will mccormack ) and trusty comanche tom ( nathaniel arcand ) , after four years of fighting for the rebs in the civil war , return to liberty , missouri - only to discover union troops are occupying their hometown .

how did this creature come into existence , and why does it feed on hormones ?
the "" scientific "" explanation cooked up by the four -- yes , four -- credited screenwriters ( amy holden jones , john raffo , rick jaffa , and amanda silver ) takes "" suspension of disbelief "" to new heights , even by monster movie standards .
but as cockamamie as the science is in the film , it is n't quite as hard to swallow as the casting of the clueless penelope
ann miller as a brilliant molecular biologist who specializes in evolutionary genetics .
miller acts as if she wants an oscar nomination , turning every scene that requires the slightest display of emotion into an overblown oscar clip , complete with piercing wails and glycerine tears .
give it up , penelope --
it 's a _

on the flip side , tom sizemore just phones in his performance as a police lieutenant , but his role is so thankless that it 's hard to imagine it being played any more effectively .
it 's quite funny to see a film indulge , with the straightest of faces , in all those cheesy horror movie cliches that wes craven lampooned so well ( and so recently ) in scream .
for example , in one early scene , a museum security guard goes into a bathroom stall late at night .
ok , we all know what 's coming , but as if we did n't need any more confirmation , he pulls out a joint and starts puffing away .
everyone knows what happens to people who do drugs in a scary movie .

does she make a beeline for the front door ?
of course not -- she runs into the ladies room and cowers in a stall .

high school guidance counselor sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) is well - liked in the town of blue bay , especially by pretty , popular kelly van ryan ( denise richards ) , whose family name is among the florida yachting enclave 's most financially prominent .
hoping to take her crush to a physical level , kelly seductively slinks into lombardo 's house after washing his jeep for a fundraiser , but , the very next day , tearfully admits to her trollop mother ( theresa russell ) that she was raped .
before long , blue bay detectives ray duquette ( kevin bacon ) and gloria perez ( daphne rubin - vega ) are listening to similar allegations from kelly 's rebel classmate suzie toller ( neve campbell ) .
lombardo , who maintains his innocence , hires neck brace - sporting , opportunistic lawyer ken
bowden ( bill murray ) to defend him in court .
the previews give away the following revelations , so if you have n't seen any of the movie 's spots on the television or in the theater , you might want to skip to the next paragraph .
while cross - examining suzie on the witness stand , bowden gets her to break down and admit that the alleged rapes never took place -- that kelly had concocted this entire scheme because she was angry that lombardo was sleeping with her mother and not with her .
to pay lombardo for the damages , kelly 's mother breaks her daughter 's trust fund and gives him $ 8 . 5 million .
but lombardo , kelly and suzie are actually all working together , and plan to take the money and run as fast as they can .
duquette and perez , however , begin to suspect that there 's more afoot to the case than just false accusations .
if there 's a major drawback to "" wild things , "" it 's that it 's oversexed to a fault .
the much - talked - about hotel room menage - a - trois between dillon , campbell and richards is a turn - off .
it 's also cut short ( sorry , guys ) , and should have been cut shorter -- the movie grinds to a halt for pure titillation once too often .
what we do n't see is far more effective than what we do .
another example of this is kevin bacon needlessly going the full monty in a shower scene .
er , no thanks .
also , bacon 's duquette feels simultaneously underdeveloped and overwritten .
daphne rubin - vega , from broadway 's "" rent , "" tries to compensate for a superfluous character .
theresa russell is just plain wooden .
and when , in the end , all is out in the open , ask yourself if certain scenes involving these three were really necessary .
but what keeps the movie from being
throwaway junk is an engaging chain of surprises
( some predictable , some not ) that never seems to end .
"" wild things "" has more twists than a crate full of corkscrews , and most are so gleefully , over - the - top nasty that you ca n't help but be charmed by their absurd showmanship .
a great deal of amusement also comes from watching bill murray in a supporting part that appears to have been written for his sly comedic talent ;
murray 's a stitch , especially when pulling up beside the van ryan limo after winning lombardo 's case and flipping them off .
and do n't leave when the closing credits hit the screen , or you 'll miss the film 's best part -- four bonus flashbacks that smooth over plot holes while offering a few more tiny turns , plus a final scene that caps everything off with a great stunner of a bombshell .
speaking of bombshells , denise richards , who plays almost every scene in a blue bikini top , does the teen tease thing with a malicious allure that she was never allowed to flaunt in "" starship troopers .

matt dillon flexes
his sleepy - voiced sex appeal , and pulls off personality changes with chameleonic precision .
neve campbell ,

"good films are hard to find these days .
great films are beyond rare .
proof of life , russell crowe 's one - two punch of a deft kidnap and rescue thriller , is one of those rare gems

i have n't seen this much chemistry between actors since mcqueen and mcgraw teamed up in peckinpah 's masterpiece , the getaway .
but enough with the gossip , let 's get to the review .
the film revolves around the kidnapping of peter bowman ( david morse ) , an american engineer working in south america who is kidnapped during a mass ambush of civilians by anti - government soldiers . upon discovering his identity , the rebel soldiers decide to ransom him for $ 6 million .
the only problem is that the company peter bowman works for is being auctioned off , and no one will step forward with the money .
with no choice available to her , bowman 's wife alice ( ryan ) hires terry thorne ( crowe ) , a highly skilled negotiator and rescue operative , to arrange the return of her husband .
but when things go wrong -- as they always do in these situations -- terry and his team ( which includes the most surprising casting choice of the year : david caruso ) take matters into their own hands .
the film is notable in that it takes this very simple story line and
creates a complex and intelligent character - driven vehicle filled with well - written dialogue , shades of motivation , and convincing acting by all the actors .
the script is based on both a book ( the long march to freedom ) and a magazine article pertaining to kidnap / ransom situations , and the story has been sharply pieced together by tony gilroy , screenwriter of the devil 's advocate and dolores claiborne .
the biggest surprise for me was not the chemistry between crowe and ryan , but
that between crowe and david caruso .
dug out from b - movie hell , caruso pulls off a gutsy performance as crowe 's right hand gun while providing most of the film 's humor .
ryan cries a lot and smokes too many cigarettes , david morse ends up getting everyone at the guerilla camp to hate him , and crowe provides another memorable acting turn as the stoic , gunslinger character of terry thorne .
the most memorable pieces of the film lie in its action scenes .
the bulk of those scenes , which bookend the movie , work extremely well as establishment and closure devices for all of the story 's characters .
the scenes are skillfully crafted and executed with amazing accuracy and poise .
director taylor hackford mixes both his old - school style of filmmaking with the dizziness of a lars von trier film .
proof of life is a thinking man 's action movie .
it is a film about the choices men and women make in the face of love and war , and the sacrifices one makes for those choices -- the sacrifices that help you sleep at night .",1,"['an intelligent script , and masterful directing', 'provides another memorable acting turn', 'skillfully crafted and executed with amazing accuracy and poise', 'is one of those rare gems', 'work extremely well as establishment and closure devices', 'delivers something virtually unheard of', ""i have n't seen this much chemistry between actors"", 'pulls off a gutsy performance', 'has been sharply pieced together', 'genuine motivation in a story that rings true', 'creates a complex and intelligent character - driven vehicle filled with well - written dialogue , shades of motivation , and convincing acting by all the actors', 'a taut drama laced with strong and subtle acting']"

disney 's latest animated feature throws us right into the action from the very beginning , skipping the usual main title sequence and putting us on pitching waves as a small family attempts to escape from a sinking ship .
father , mother , and infant somehow make it to shore amidst a rousing song by phil collins , and have soon built a treehouse which would impress the swiss family robinson .
it 's amazing , the kinds of things you can do when you work to a soundtrack .
before you know it , an unfortunate set of circumstances put the baby in the hands of kala ( glenn close ) , a mother ape who recently lost her own baby to a predatory leopard . against the wishes of her mate and family leader , kerchak ( lance henricksen ) , she takes on the infant boy as her own .
tarzan is not so much a story about a human boy surviving in the african jungles as it is about one who does not really fit in either humanity or the wild .
much of tarzan 's young life is spent trying to become one of the apes in the eyes of his peers and his "" father , "" which occasionally gets him into trouble no matter how well - meant his attempts .
all he 's looking for is acceptance , perhaps a goal easily identifiable by young viewers , but one which will ring true with a lot of adults .
when you really think about it , this story fits right into the disney formula of the outcast that triumphs in the end .
look back on past disney animated features and you 'll see the trend .
growing up , tarzan ( voiced by alex d .
linz as a child , and by tony goldwyn as an adult ) has a couple of friends .
one is an ape named terk ( rosie o'donnell ) , and the other is a paranoid hypochondriac of an elephant named tantor ( wayne knight ) .
both provide the requisite comic relief ( timon and poombah from the lion king immediately come to mind ) and perform the usual hijinks as prescribed by the disney mold .
i 'm beginning to think anyone can write the screenplay for one of these films .
just fill in the blanks !
can you see it ?
"" now we have to have a couple of zany friends for out hero who might get him into mischief , but cover for him or come to his rescue when he needs it .
we 've already had a fish and a crab , and we 've had a candle and a teapot , a genie and a dog , a few stone statues . . . .
have we had an ape and an elephant yet ?
well , there we go !
""
of course , there 's got ta be romance somewhere along the line , so jane ( minnie driver ) gets introduced about halfway through . together with her father
dr .
porter ( nigel hawthorne ) and the big game hunter clayton ( brian blessed )
, jane is on an expedition to find and study the wild gorillas of africa .
she discovers the man raised by apes and is enchanted almost immediately , and soon shares an amusing version of the compulsory "" you tarzan , me jane "" scene .
thankfully , those are n't the exact words .
however , i found it distracting that tarzan is going "" ohh ohh ee ee "" one second and then tells jane his name in this manly voice with perfect diction .
how does he tell his name to another ape ?
"" ohh ohh ee - tarzan - ee ee ohh ?
""
well , regardless of my picky nature , the romance actually works as only disney romance can : purely contrived , but for some reason rather believable .
but hey , tarzan 's a young adult .
do you think he dated a few of the female apes before meeting jane ?
is n't that illegal in most countries ?
oh , well .
i do n't think disney will be using my quote anymore .
tarzan departs from the usual disney feature in that this one is not a musical .
there 's lots of music to be sure , but not a single character song in the whole hour and a half of running time .
we instead get more of a phil collins concert , as no less than five of his original songs are used as interlude material .
this is n't really a bad thing , as
the songs are very high - energy and catchy
( i found myself singing one to myself for most of the following day ) ; it 's just different .
do yourself a favor and see this film in a theater with a good sound system , because the music will come through astonishingly well and really enhance the movie .
with each new feature , disney animation gets even better .
not necessarily by leaps and bounds , but since they put out a new film each year , a steady rate of improvement is apparent , and this definitely shows in tarzan .
there are a couple of scenes where the animation achieves a near 3-d effect , and a number of scenes which feature tarzan moving through the trees are absolutely dizzying .
the way he slides down tree limbs and trunks is very reminiscent of skateboarding and rollerblading maneuvers , and had me thinking this is n't just tarzan , it 's "" extreme tarzan . "" however , tarzan does not seem to have what i call its "" chandelier scene , "" which is the one scene to which the animators have chosen to devote an inordinate amount of effort , utilizing a computer - assisted process that makes the animation absolutely breathtaking .
lasting but a few seconds at most , it 's been the signature of nearly every disney animated feature since beauty and the beast , in which the castle ballroom chandelier was rendered in stunning detail . as usual ,
the voice talent is up to snuff , convincingly make you believe in the convictions of animated characters .
the one poor choice in casting , however , was rosie o'donnell .
going into the film , i did n't know she was even a part of it , but when terk started talking , i recognized her voice immediately .
her performance was fine , but through the rest of the film i kept thinking , "" that 's no boy ape , that rosie o'donnell .
"" distracting to say the least .
i 'll admit i 've never read the edgar rice burroughs story "" tarzan of the apes , "" so i could n't tell you how true this film stays to the book .
but unless you 're a purist , you should have few objections to this film .
with solid performances , action , adventure , a bit of romance , and great music and animation , tarzan should appeal to the kids and to the kid in all of us .
note : when i wrote my review of mulan a year ago , i went off on the promotional and merchandising tie - ins prevalent with the release of a disney animated feature .
this time , i 'll just say that i went to mcdonald 's yesterday to treat myself to a mcflurry , and tarzan was on the cup .

"although many people have compared this new gangster comedy to the hit hbo drama ' the sopranos , ' analyze this is witty and entertaining enough to be a good movie in it 's own right .
billy crystal plays wiseguy shrink ben sobol , who new ' patient ' happens to be gangster boss paul vitti ( de niro . )
ben wants nothing to do with vitti , as he 's about to get married to laura macnamara ( kudrow ) and having a gangster as a patient would n't really help .
but ben is soon drawn into vitti worlds , and reluctantly helps vitti to sort his life out .
all done in a comic fashion , of course .
although never brilliant , analyze this is also never rubbish , which makes for a fun ride .
billy crystal , who has n't had a good role since city slickers way back in the early ' 90 's , is given a role that lets him fully exploit his wiseguy act .
he 's pretty funny while he does it , and although his character is a little close to his character in city slickers ,
he 's pretty funny .
robert de niro is hilarious as vitti , playing it dead straight but coming off as really funny .
he 's a serious gangster unaware that he is a comic gold mine .
lisa kudrow , barely seen as crystals ' estranged wife to be , basically reprises her phoebe role from t .
v series friends , which is getting rather tiresome , and does n't come off well on the screen .
the supporting cast is apparently made up of the entire cast of casino and goodfellas , and are all funny caricatures , especially vitti 's bodyguard jelly ( joe viterelli . )
the film genuinely plays like a proper gangster movie , but with laughs instead of hard ass talking .
it sometimes gets a little bloody for a light hearted film , but it strangely fits in .
spoofs are made of famous gangster movies , including a nice parody of the godfather .
the italian tunes playing throughout the soundtrack contribute to the fun .
there 's also some odd plot points : fbi guys appear and suddenly disappear for no apparent reason .
it is true that analyze this has had a somewhat chequered production history , and perhaps the plot points were expanded in a earlier version of the script .
unfortunately , this is hollywood , so we will never know .
harold ramis , best known as egon from ghostbusters , has a deft touch with directing comedy , as shown in the immortal groundhog day , and the less immortal caddyshack .
all the comic potential in a scene is dug out and presented to the audience .
the script , written by ramis along with peter tolan and ken lonergan , starts off funny , remains funny for the most of the film , but sadly peters out somewhat during the last twenty minutes where it wrongly enters more serious territory .
the film is short , however , and just before audience interest is waning the film suddenly goes into a rather rushed and unsatisfying ending and the credits roll .
analyze this is a good comedy , and is certainly worth watching .
robert de niro sobbing is reason enough to watch it , even though it does seem forced , or like a parody ( although i think this was intentional . )
crystal is his most likeable in years
, kudrow is given as little screen time as possible , which is a good thing , and de niro
is just awesome .
it 's no goodfellas , and it probably wo n't be remembered as much as groundhog day , but analyze this is a well done comedy that wo n't leave you feel cheated .",1,"['is hilarious', 'are all funny caricatures', 'starts off funny , remains funny for the most of the film', 'is a good comedy , and is certainly worth watching', 'is just awesome', ""he 's pretty funny"", ""he 's pretty funny"", 'coming off as really funny', 'it strangely fits in', 'is his most likeable in years', 'makes for a fun ride', ""a well done comedy that wo n't leave you feel cheated"", 'contribute to the fun', 'lets him fully exploit his wiseguy act', ""witty and entertaining enough to be a good movie in it 's own right"", 'all the comic potential in a scene is dug out and presented to the audience']"
"if you 're debating whether or not to see _
breakfast_of_champions _ , ask yourself one simple question : do you want to see nick nolte in lingerie ?
the only people who would get much enjoyment from alan rudolph 's chaotic adaptation of the kurt vonnegut novel is the cross - section of the population with the unhealthy urge to see that unpleasant sight .
everyone else -- and
i 'm hoping that 's most people -- would be wise to
steer clear of this excrutiatingly unfunny mess .
actually , though , the sight of nolte in high heels is one of the more amusing things about this muddle , which focuses dwayne hoover ( bruce willis ) , the owner of dwayne hoover 's exit 11 motor village in midland city .
not only is he a huge success as a businessman , he 's also something of a celebrity , his face made recognizable by an ongoing series of television commercials .
with a nice home and family to boot , dwayne appears to have it all the ingredients to be happy -- yet he 's not .
his wife celia ( barbara hershey ) is perpetually in a pill - induced haze ; his son george ( lukas haas ) is a flamboyant lounge singer who goes by the stage name "" bunny .
""
not only that , the environmental protection agency is on dwayne 's ass over a building development project .
it 's enough to send dwayne on a nervous breakdown
-- that is , if he does n't succeed in blowing his brains out first .
meanwhile , midland city is about to host a fine arts festival , and the guest of honor is one kilgore trout ( albert finney ) , a writer who is far from the renowned author the festival 's organizer ( buck henry ) was led to believe -- in fact , he 's a penniless hack who writes second - rate sci - fi that appears in porn magazines .
his trek to midland city is also a spiritual journey , one that reaches its apex after meeting dwayne , who for some reason thinks that trout will hold for him all of life 's answers .
the above is already a longer plot synopsis than i usually give in my reviews , but , ironically , i have barely scratched the surface .
i have n't yet mentioned wayne hoobler ( omar epps ) , an ex - con with an obsessive admiration for the similarly - named dwayne .
then there 's the matter of francine ( glenne headly ) , dwayne 's devoted secretary .
not to mention dwayne 's employee and old friend harry lesabre ( nolte ) , the one with the secret penchant for cross - dressing .
and so on .
the film is essentially dwayne 's story , but too often rudolph goes on distracting tangents with the eccentric peripheral players that one often wonders what the point is .
rudolph does arrive at a point ( more on that later ) , but it 's blunted and obscured by his hyperactive approach to the material .
the surreal visual style , complete with printed words flying through the air and into dwayne 's ears , is obviously meant to convey a sense of madness , but its bludgeoning nature is likely to make viewers mad .
the actors are called on to act accordingly , resulting in some of the worst , most overdone work
all of them have ever turned in .
willis fares best of all --
but that 's because his frozen expression of befuddled bewilderment mirrors that of the audience .
with such an aggressively outrageous atmosphere for nearly all of its running time , it comes as a shock when things suddenly turn serious , and rudolph tries to make a statement .
unlike _ american_beauty _ ( a film that _ breakfast _ resembles in more than a few ways , to its great detriment ) , there is n't any palpably earnest undercurrent that would prepare the audience for the big shift . as such , the cartoony characters fail to win a sympathy that needs to be earned ; and the film attempts , to no avail , to reach a profundity that it does n't deserve .
vonnegut 's original novel is considered a classic , but it had been called unfilmable -- the same that was said of hunter s .
thompson 's _
fear_and_loathing_in_las_vegas _ , which was disastrously committed to film last year by terry gilliam .
with the similar failure of
_ breakfast_of_champions _ , will hollywood ever learn that books labeled "" unfilmable "" inevitably results in a film that is unwatchable ?
likely not .",0,"['steer clear of this excrutiatingly unfunny mess', 'the similar failure', 'a film that is unwatchable', 'the cartoony characters', ""it 's blunted and obscured by his hyperactive approach"", 'some of the worst , most overdone work', 'muddle', 'its bludgeoning nature is likely to make viewers mad', ""the film attempts , to no avail , to reach a profundity that it does n't deserve"", 'that unpleasant sight']"
"copyright 1996 graeme huggan carry on henry is all about henry viii and his eight wives !
sid james plays henry , who no sooner has the film started , is getting rid of his present queen and hopes to find another one soon .
as part of his alliance with france , he requests the hand - in - marriage to the queen of normandy ( joan sims ) .
she comes to england in the hope of marrying henry
but when he finds out that she loves garlic and has a reeking garlic breath , he is totally averse to the idea of marriage .
henry 's court is very corrupt , with the cardinal ( terry scott ) trying to bribe cromwell ( kenneth williams ) and cromwell trying to bribe the king .
there is a state of crisis when the king puts marie the queen ( sims ) in the tower of london ready for execution .
the queen is pregnant but she has not liased with the king before , so fingers are pointed at sir roger de lodgerley played by charles hawtrey , who has a rather lecherous character to play this time .
the cardinal and cromwell decide to get a signed confession from sir roger by using all kinds of torture devices !
owing to circumstances , sir roger is sometimes needed to sign that he is the father and
sometimes that he is n't .
this is because of renewed threats by the king of france ( peter gilmore ) to come over himself , which in the end he does .
by then , henry has found himself a new queen , played by none other than barbara windsor !
it looks like he has some explaining to do !
there are stand - out performances by sid james as henry , joan sims as marie , and terry scott in an unusual role as the cardinal .
also there are cameos from kenneth connor and peter butterworth , who plays barbara 's father .
the set and costume design is first class and the overall production of this film is good .
there is even an early appearance from david prowse , who later became the green cross code man and darth vader .
the film does have it 's downsides though , as it is getting pretty routine for the carry - on team to stage historical films and the inventive streak of the script seems to run out pretty quickly .
there is also the absence of hattie jacques and bernard bresslaw , who could have helped the film along . however ,
overall the film is funny and there are plenty of laughs and saucy
jokes
, so that is why i mainly recommend it to carry on fans only , but there is enough humour in the film to make it worth anyone 's

"felix ( sami bouajila , "" the siege "" ) lives a contented life with his boyfriend daniel ( pierre - loup rajot ) in the little town of dieppe in northern france .
when he is laid off from his job , after discovering the address of the father who abandoned him before he was born , he decides to journey to marseilles , in the south , to find the man he never met in "" the adventures of felix .
""
writers / directors olivier ducastel and jacques martineau made their debut with the musical comedy "" jeanne and the perfect guy , "" embracing that typically american genre .
their second effort , "" the adventures of felix , "" once again borrows from america with a tale of a young man who hits the road to find himself .
felix is happy with his life in dieppe , but when the ferry company he works for falls prey to the economics of the chunnel , he is out of a job and at loose ends .
when he goes through his late mother 's papers he learns that the father he never knew is living in marseilles , hundreds of miles away .
felix makes the snap decision to journey to the south , puts together a supply of "" cocktails "" for his hiv virus , kisses daniel goodbye and heads off on foot .
he refuses to use trains and wants to avoid big cities as he hitchhikes across france to find his destiny .
along the way , a series of chance encounters with various strangers teaches felix that family is not always made up of blood relations .
on the road , he witnesses a race - related mugging that turns into murder and , frightened for his own safety , runs away without telling the police .
following this harrowing experience , he has his first chance meeting that begins the unconscious construction of his ideal family .
his journey brings him to rouen , and the film 's first title section , "" my little brother , "" where he meets jules , a young art student who becomes smitten with felix .
they steal a car and develop a chaste , brotherly affection before felix must move on .
he next meets elderly mathilde ( patachou ) , in the chapter titled "" my grandmother , "" and soon learns that she , too , has a fondness for the same tv soap opera that felix has grown addicted to .
she wants him to stay with her , but he must continue on his way to find his father .
in the weakest chapter of felix 's road trip , titled "" my cousin , "" he meets a railroad worker ( philippe garziano ) and has a brief sexual encounter before heading off , once again , toward marseilles .
he next helps a stranded lady motorist , isabelle ( ariane ascaride ) , and shags a ride with her and her three kids ( each with a different daddy ) in the sequence titled "" my sister .
""
he is torn by the inner turmoil of not going to the police about the murder he witnessed and isabelle comforts him just as a sister would .
on the final leg of the journey titled "" my father , "" he meets an older man , a fisherman ( maurice benichou ) , who enlightens him about the real facts of life and family while they fly felix 's kite , just like a father and son .
""
the adventures of felix "" has a number of things going for it as we follow felix on his journey of discovery .
first and foremost is the charming performance by sami bouajila as felix .
he is a likable guy , fighting his hiv with his doses of "" cocktails , "" and lights up the screen as he makes the long walk , often with dance and song , to find his father and himself .
as he encounters each member of his new family , promising each that he will send a postcard when he arrives at his final destination , he grows a little bit more spiritually and emotionally .
bouajila does a terrific job holding center stage on the screen .
the cast of characters making up felix 's new - found family are nearly as charming as the star , each in their own way . patachou , especially , is wonderful as the grandma character and a kindred spirit to felix .
ariane ascaride , along with her kids , gives a perf that really makes you think of her as the sister that the young man never had .
only the "" cousin "" chapter lacks the emotional depth of the rest and feels like a perfunctory addition to felix 's "" family .
"" "" the adventures of felix "" does not reinvent the road movie , but it does provide a charismatic telling of a young man 's journey to find himself and , to his surprise , his discovery is dramatically different than he expected at the beginning .
it helps that cinematographer matthieu poirot - delpech 's crisp lensing compliments the story perfectly as felix moves across the french countryside .

"there have been bad films in recent years : ' mr .
magoo ' was by far the worst ever made , the spectacularly bad ' blue in the face ' , the horrible ' baby genuises ' and now ' i woke up early the day i died ' .
it may not however be the worst movie made but it certainly ranks as one bad movie .
the film 's acting ( if that 's what you want to call it ) is
well mediocre to me .
loaded with a sensational cast you would think that the cast would at least save the film a bit , boy was i wrong .
after escaping from a mental institution ' the thief ' played by billy zane goes out in the real world and finds that it is pretty harsh and gritty .
he turns to burglary to survive , robs a loan back , kills the loan officer and runs with thousands .
a country - wide man hunt is on for him to catch him and bring him down .
he ends up in a cemetery where he puts his money in a coffin to keep it for later , comes back and realizes that someone took it and put it somewhere .
now he is determined to kill all the visitors at the funeral earlier that day until he gets his money back , ultimately leading to a finale that is less that satisfying .
a film which was based on a ' long - lost ' script by ed wood , i have only one question : no dialogue , only music and movement
where exactly is the point ?
the film moves along at a rather slow pace , but does have one advantage : the soundtrack which is catchy and vibrant except the first song which can be offensive to some .
it opens with a fun , innovative opening credits sequence and quickly goes downhill after that .
some of the low points are when ' the thief ' steals a woman 's purse , and then she faints , sandra bernhard as a dancer and tippi hendren as a deaf woman whom ' the thief ' kills to the music of ' psycho ' . come on people get some new ideas already !
what 's even worse is that the film has no plot at all .
well to a certain extent it does , but who cares by the time the middle of the film arrives
we 're bored out of our mind and ready for something fun and exciting to happen . '
i woke up early the day i died ' is a perfectly bad film .
it shows us how low filmmakers get sometimes just when desperate to make a movie .

"let 's get this one over with as quickly as possible .
if there was a possibility to receive a refund , this review would not be forthcoming .
but as it is , "" godzilla "" is without a doubt the loudest , longest , and ultimately most amateurishly written film ever released through a major studio .
producer dean devlin and director roland emmerich should be ashamed of themselves , and as penance be forced to return to film school to watch "" last year at merienbad "" until they can grasp the idea of content and plot .
no amount of hype , no amount of money can hide the fact that these filmmakers are the 90s equivalent to william beaudine ( billy the kid vs .
dracula ) .
"" godzilla "" opens with stock footage of the bikini atoll nuclear tests interspersed with footage of iguanas playfully swimming and nuzzling their eggs .
we are then introduced to the crew of a japanese fish canning ship ( a questionable enterprise considering that tuna processing is supposed to be supervised to eliminate the netting of dolphins ) .
well , the ship is attacked and sunk by an unseen creature .
later , a group of frenchmen led by philippe roache ( jean reno ) interview the sole survivor .
in a state of shock , the only thing the man can utter is the word "" gojira "" ( the japanese name of the famed beast ) .
we are then introduced to dr .
nick tatopoulos ( matthew broderick , with a moniker obviously taken from the effects designer of the film ) .
he is currently studying the effects that the chernobyl disaster has had on the local earthworm population .
he is immediately drafted by the u . s .
military and taken to panama where he is shown the huge footprints of a creature .
in a short amount of time , another fishing boat ( loaded with canned tuna from the u . s . and korea for some reason ) is found grounded in jamaica .
well , it seems that whatever is eating these ships is headed for new york .
when the beast finally appears , he tears up one building , stomps a couple of trucks and makes life hell for the incumbent mayor ebert ( thumbs up for new york ) .
the military , with dr .
tatopoulos 's help , have two tons of fresh fish dumped in the middle of new york to lure the beast out of its hiding place in the new york subway system .
it finally comes crashing through the city streets and has a cute face to face with dr .
tatopoulos who snaps the beast 's picture .
the monster eats the fish , the military starts shooting , and the chase is on , with the army causing 90 % of the ensuing damage .
working from a hunch as to why godzilla has decided to come to the big apple , dr .
totopoulos buys a few home pregnancy kits from a local drugstore that has chosen to remain open ( even though new york has been evacuated ) .
well the test proves that the monster is a hermaphrodite and is pregnant .
needless to say , no one believes the good doctor about his discovery , so he must join up with the renegade french secret service agents and find the monster 's nesting site and destroy the eggs before the mayor starts letting the populous back into the city ( even though the monster is n't dead yet ) .
i sincerely hope that i 've completely spoiled any interest anyone might have of seeing this film .
i gave away the relevant plot so that i could spare those of you courageous ( or foolish ) enough to drop down an hour 's wage on this tripe .
everything about "" godzilla "" reeks almost as bad as the piles of rotting fish used to trap the beast .
the script ( and let 's be clear here ) by devlin and emmerich is so full of plot holes and non characters as to be sure to be the recipient of next years "" razzie "" award .
the dialogue between maria pitillo ( as audrey timmonds , dr .
tatopoulos ' estranged girlfriend ) and mr .
broderick is so adolescent
, it makes teenagers giggle in disbelief ( as happened during the screening i witnessed ) .
the film could be enjoyably campy if it did n't take itself so damn seriously .
but to what end , as there is no commentary on humanities foibles against nature , nor is there any reference about godzilla being some sort of retaliation against mankind .
no .
godzilla is just a big dummy that got knocked up by some french immigrants and decided to let the state of new york pay for it .
the film is bleak and ugly looking . taking place at night during a rain storm , the movie has little or no depth .
everything is ugly and dark .
new york has never looked so inhospitable since "" death wish "" .
in an attempt to give the film some color , audrey timmonds carries a bright red umbrella which is unique in that everyone else in the film carries the standard gray issue .
the only moment of composition and color is during the brief scenes on jamaica , where dr .
tatopoulos finds himself standing in a giant footprint .
the scene is nicely photographed but poorly set up .
you know from the outset that nick is standing in a footprint .
for a scientist , this is very poor observation .
let 's look at some of the more interesting plot holes in the film ( this activity , is becoming almost as popular as the kevin bacon game )
: 1 . )
why does the french nuclear tests only affect one clutch of iguana eggs , and how do those eggs fuse into one beast ?
2 . )
why would a cold blooded creature choose a cold climate ( such as new york ) to nest ?
i do n't think iguana 's have a habit of migrating .
3 . )
how can godzilla crawl through the new york subway system , slice a submarine in half , yet be unable to extricate himself from some thin ( in comparison ) steel cable on the brooklyn bridge ?
4 . )
the brooklyn bridge is the only suspension bridge in existence that does not need it 's suspension cables .
5 .
) did godzilla carry all two hundred eggs in her belly ?
if so , then radioactive mutations surely are wondrous creatures .
( note : each egg is 10 feet tall and almost as wide .
godzilla would have to be over 1 , 000 feet tall to carry them all ) .
6 . )
godzilla can crush ships and eat helicopters , but new york cabs are made of stronger steel .
7 . )
godzilla can out maneuver helicopters , bullets , torpedoes and missiles , but ca n't catch you on foot .
8 . )
taxis can out maneuver godzilla .
9 . )
godzilla can burrow through the subway system but ca n't tear through the park avenue tunnel .
10 . )
why was nothing else mutated by the nuclear test as quickly as godzilla ?
maybe a giant hermit crab in the sequel .
11 . )
galapagos iguana 's actually live in the french polynesian islands ?
12 . )
why was dr .
tatopoulos brought in by the military if they were not going to listen to him anyway ?
13 . )
how did they evacuate new york island in less than a day , and how did they convince those new yorkers to go to new jersey ?
14 . )
new york television stations use vhs tape for both filming and broadcasting .
new yorkers hate beta cam .
i could go on and on , but that would only serve to make the film seem more enjoyable than it is .
do n't be fooled , this film has less gray matter than any episode of "" america 's funniest home videos "" .
the performances in the film are singularly bland .
not one performance belays any awe or fear in the face of this two hundred foot tall terror .
the characters , in the midst of the onslaught , have time to stop and discuss the lack of good coffee , failed relationships , career choices .
the only common occurrence that does n't take place here is having one of the characters have a bowel movement , but then that would have made them believable .
godzilla for the most part is okay .
the design of the beast is funky , if not very memorable .
one thing that comes to mind-- the major redirection of godzilla in this film is to remove his most familiar trademark , namely his atomic breath .
now , i for one ca n't quite fathom how you can call this monster godzilla without that little trait .
a good comparison would be to make a superman film and eliminate his ability to fly .
there is so much wrong with this film that i ca n't really recall anything recently that has left me this cold hearted ( except for my divorce ) .
any film that can have a two ton lizard slipping on gum balls has got to be envisioned under the influence of prozac .
the addition of the baby raptors ( ah , i meant godzillas ) , are nothing but a direct rip off of ' jurassic park "" , but with none of that film 's suspense or tension .
suffice to say that , "" godzilla "" is without a doubt the most brain dead motion picture of the decade

this is a film that needed the hype .
with the current level of writing and directing , nothing else about the film succeeds .

the gift , "" directed by sam raimi , is a tried - and - true effort that surprises very little , and includes everything from a wide array of suspects and red herrings , to mansions in the deep south with moss trees out front , to the eventual discovery of a waterlogged corpse found in a nearby pond .
it 's fairly obvious who the killer is ;
in fact , i predicted who it would be before the movie began and was correct in my preliminary suspicions .
the film ultimately should n't work , but it does , thanks to a sparkling cast that fills each character with so many memorable nuances , the most fun to be had is in simply watching the people interact with each other

annie wilson ( cate blanchett ) is a recently widowed mother of three sons who makes her living giving psychic readings to the residents of her backwater southern hometown .
some of her mainstay clients include valerie barksdale ( hilary swank ) , who is severely abused by her husband donnie ( keanu reeves ) , and buddy cole ( giovanni ribisi ) , an unstable mechanic who is confused by the nightmares he 's been having about a mysterious blue diamond that is somehow linked to his father .
for annie , she does not give the readings merely for money , but uses it as a way of seeking solace in finding the good in everyone 's future .
her late grandmother ( rosemary harris ) told her as a child that it was a gift she was given , and she should always remember that .
when annie 's eldest son is involved in a fight at school , she meets the nice - guy school principal , wayne collins ( greg kinnear ) , whom she finds herself attracted to .
but wayne is engaged to the wealthy jessica king ( katie holmes ) , whom annie immediately gets a negative vibe about .
at a party with her best friend linda ( kim dickens ) , annie stumbles upon jessica in a compromising position with lawyer david duncan ( gary cole ) .
soon after , jessica has disappeared , leaving everyone in a frenzy over what could have possibly happened to her , and annie starts to have nightmares and apparitions linking jessica with the vicious redneck donnie barksdale , and the pond behind his home .
""
the gift "" may be cliched on a sheer storytelling level , but the performances and tight direction from raimi ( who has redeemed himself for his embarrassing last film , 1999 's "" for love of the game "" ) lift the picture up several notches .
slowly enveloping the viewer into the many intriguing characters and their individual plights , the disappearance of jessica at the 30-minute mark divulges the movie 's true intentions and transforms the proceedings into a taut , at times frightening , horror - mystery .
at the center of the film is the exceptional cate blanchett ( 1999 's "" the talented mr .
ripley "" ) , who turns annie wilson from what could have been little more than a run - of - the - mill protagonist into a very exact , down - to - earth , realistic person with valid troubles and a caring attitude towards those around her .
blanchett takes the unextraordinary material and runs with it , giving the entire film a truly classy aura that it otherwise might not have had .
we follow her at every turn because she is so mesmerizing , both as a character and an actress .
blanchett is n't the only bright performer , as she is ably supported by one of the best casts of the year .
in her first role following her oscar win for 1999 's "" boys do n't cry , "" hilary swank is excellent as the confused valerie , who seeks guidance from annie , but is too scared to take her biggest advice of all : to leave the grossly abusive donnie .
as donnie , keanu reeves ( 2000 's "" the watcher "" ) makes an utterly convincing backwoods meanie , so much so that it is difficult to believe he is an actor at all
.
for the often - criticized reeves , whose acting abilities have never been the best , this is the biggest compliment he could possibly get , and it is also one of the better performances he has given .
giovanni ribisi ( 2000 's "" the boiler room "" ) is heartbreaking as a mentally slow young man who sees annie as his only friend , and wants her to do nothing but help him understand why he is being plagued by bad dreams about his dad .
in the small , but pivotal role of the sleazy jessica king , katie holmes ( 2000 's "" wonder boys "" ) has turned in yet another stunning supporting turn .
her promiscuous role of jessica is one she has never played before , and
she is radiant in her few scenes .
finally , kim dickens ( 2000 's "" hollow man "" ) makes her usual strong impression as annie 's spicy best friend , linda .
the other notable aspect of "" the gift "" is its moody atmosphere that lays such a thickly foreboding air over every scene it 's almost suffocating .
thanks to cleverly construed editing by arthur coburn and bob murawski , and the successful use of different eerie sounds effects and a very good music score by christopher young , the movie not only achieves a scary undercurrent , but one that is filled with dread . helped along by a strong screenplay by billy bob thornton and tom epperson , which makes the most of its setting and delightful cast , "" the gift "" is
that rarest of thrillers that actually thrills , and offers up a fair share of chills , too .

"some critics , including siskel & ebert , are on the record stating that martin scorsese 's raging bull , the story of boxer jake la motta , is the best film of the ' 80s . since there are still a number of ' 80s films that i have n't seen , i do n't feel qualified to make such a judgment , but i 'll say this without hesitation : raging bull is a great motion picture , and i would be surprised if more than a handful of films released between january 1 , 1980 and december 31 , 1989 come close to its level .
bio - pics often fall into one of two categories : overblown hero- worship or a dry , dull textbook account .
it 's rare that a movie with the moniker "" based on the life of ? "" comes across as anything more than sporadically energetic and marginally entertaining .
raging bull is the perfect counterexample , and a brilliant argument for film makers to continue to work in this genre .
the picture takes the life of boxer jake la motta , a middleweight icon from the ' 40s and ' 50s , and develops one of the most compelling character studies ever to reach the big screen .
for all 129 minutes , director martin scorsese and actor robert de niro ( in the title role ) have us mesmerized by this individual who is by turns sympathetic , sad , and horrifying .
historically , raging bull is said to be mostly accurately , with the lion 's share of the details culled from la motta 's own autobiography ( which was co - written with joseph carter and peter savage ) .
however , although la motta is credited as the movie 's "" consultant , "" he was reportedly unhappy with the final result , because it portrays him as nothing short of an uncouth , insensitive lout .
the la motta of the movie is a man of extreme appetites who is driven by base , bestial impulses ?
paranoia , jealousy , and blind rage .
sex and violence are inextricably linked .
the title is apt ?
la motta is a raging bull .
in the ring , he is a terror , not just beating his opponents , but destroying them .
outside of it , he is no less vicious or more easily controlled .
the two people who spar with him on life 's canvas are his wife , vicki ( cathy moriarty ) , and his brother / manager , joey ( joe pesci ) .
these are the two who mean the most to jake , and who , as a result of his inability to trust himself or others , he loses .
he beats vicki mercilessly because he suspects her of infidelity , and , when he inaccurately believes that his brother betrayed him , his lets loose with an explosion of violence .
raging bull opens in 1941 when la motta , an up - and - coming fighter , is battling his way into the upper echelon of the middleweight class .
over the years , he wins several key bouts , including one against his arch - rival , sugar ray robinson ( johnny barnes ) , but his unwillingness to capitulate with the local godfather keeps him from an opportunity to participate in a championship match .
meanwhile , away from the ring , la motta falls in love with 15-year old vicki , who he marries after discarding his shrewish first wife .
vicki becomes jake 's greatest prize ( a wife , in his view , is not a companion , but a possession ) and the source of his most extreme pain .
his own insecurity is so great that he can not accept that a woman as beautiful as vicki could be faithful to him .
hence , he is constantly haunted by a belief that she is sleeping with someone else ?
perhaps even his brother .
( this leads to the famous line parodied in waiting for guffman and elsewhere : "" are you f
* * king my wife ? ? ?
"" ) in the late ' 40s , la motta gets his first shot at a championship fight , but with one huge condition : he must take a fall .
he does it so badly that an investigation is launched and he is almost thrown out of boxing .
two years later , he wins the championship , only to lose it in a subsequent bout to sugar ray .
by the late ' 50s and early ' 60s , when the film ends , jake has become a pathetic figure ?
a broke , overweight loser who has spent time in jail for corrupting the morals of a minor , has lost his wife and children , and is trying to earn a few bucks by doing a cheap standup routine .
raging bull is the other side of rocky .
sylvester stallone 's tale of boxing triumph was released to great critical acclaim in 1976 .
it won the 1977 best picture oscar , and a sequel arrived in theaters before raging bull went into production .
but , where rocky romanticizes boxing , raging bull takes a cold , unflinching look at the violence both inside and outside of the ring .
while scorsese 's primary aim is to present a riveting deconstruction of la motta the man , he never backs away from showing the seedy , ugly underside of a sport where gambling , greed , and organized crime force fighters to throw matches to continue working .
rocky shows boxing at its noblest ; raging bull shows it at its most diseased .
there 's little i can say here that has n't already said about de niro 's performance .
in a career that has included many fine roles , this is his most outstanding .
the level of intensity de niro brings to la motta is unwavering .
and , although there 's a lot of travis bickle ( de niro 's character in taxi driver ) in la motta , scorsese and de niro go to great lengths to make sure that , if we never fully sympathize with him , at least we understand the forces that drive him .
this is a complete characterization and a perfect example of acting .
as the younger jake , de niro is trim and fit .
as the fat , older man , de niro gained 50 pounds and turned his body into a grotesque parody of its normal form .
how many actors would go that far ?
the best oscar statue is only one testimony to the lasting power of the performance .
cathy moriarty and joe pesci both earned nominations for their supporting work ( although neither won ) .
their portrayals have the same raw energy that infuses
de niro 's .
pesci , who has basically re - created the same personality in two other scorsese films ( goodfellas and casino )
, presents joey as a slightly more intelligent version of his brother .
the misogyny and violence are still there , only better concealed .
but , when joey snaps , as he does in one scene where he pounds on a mobster ( frank vincent ) , it 's startling to behold .
moriarty , on the other hand , must play the temptress with virginal qualities ?
the only kind of woman who would ensnare jake .
later , she 's called upon to portray the battered wife and mother whose love has turned into fear .
scorsese and cinematographer michael chapman elected to shoot the bulk of raging bull in black - and - white ( a few "" home movie "" segments are in color ) .
the choice is perfect for the movie , giving raging bull a unique look in an era when a black - and - white approach is almost unheard of .
( one important recent exception , schindler 's list , eschewed color for some of the same reasons that raging bull did . )
in black - and - white ( especially considering scorsese 's choice of shots and use of slow motion ) , the violence is stark and disturbing .
there 's no room for romanticism in the ring with inky black blood staining the canvas .
during fight sequences , the director also uses a number of point - of - view shots designed to show the world , however briefly , from la motta 's perspective .
scorsese could have chosen to end the film with la motta 's loss to sugar ray , where he surrendered his middleweight crown .
after that , his career was all downhill .
yet the director allows the film to run for thirty minutes after this pivotal moment , stretching more than a decade into la motta 's future .
the reason is obvious : scorsese is n't as interested in boxing as he is in the character .
following his retirement , la motta is still as violent and volatile as ever , but he has lost the arena in which he can legally unleash those tendencies .
we see the results of this beast let loose on society and how the consequences of his actions reduce him to a parody of his former self .
who can not feel a surge of pity for la motta as he quietly recites marlon brando 's speech from on the waterfront ?
( "" i coulda been a contenda . "" )
perhaps raging bull is indeed the best film of the ' 80s .
and , if not , it 's certainly perilously close to the zenith .",1,"['a great motion picture', 'their portrayals have the same raw energy that infuses', 'have us mesmerized', 'this is his most outstanding', ""perhaps raging bull is indeed the best film of the ' 80s"", 'the choice is perfect', 'a brilliant argument', 'the best oscar statue is only one testimony to the lasting power of the performance']"
"a movie that 's been as highly built up as the truman show , with reviews boasting , "" the film of the decade !
""
and "" a breakthrough !
"" can only be leading up to letdown .
that 's no doubt -- it seems any movie with critical acclaim makes you think you 're going in for the ride of your life , that you 'll end up changed on the other side , and you come out of the theater going , "" eh . . .

that 's

so , naturally , the truman show was building up to what was going to be a dissapointment .

the truman show is truly "" the film of the decade "" and "" a breakthrough "" and more .
and you will come out changed on the other side .
such a movie comes around only once in a lifetime , where you find yourself feeling everything that the character is feeling , and this , friends , is it .
jim carrey shows that he does n't need to talk out of his butt to entertain us ; that he can be as dramatic as any of hollywood 's leading men .
the film has a difficult premise to tackle , trying to set us up thirty years into the "" truman show 's "" run , but tackle it it does , and perfectly .
with flashbacks actually being flashbacks on the television show , you get the sense that you are viewing a * real * prime - time hit .

"nearly every film tim burton has directed has been an homage to the horror genre -- "" frankenweenie , "" "" beetlejuice , "" "" batman ,
"" "" edward scissorhands , "" "" ed wood , "" "" mars attacks !
"" -- yet none of them have been horror films .
""
sleepy hollow "" is his first attempt to actually scare people .
i greeted the prospect with high anticipation ; burton 's whole career seemed to be leading up to this .
i left disappointed .
andrew kevin walker 's screenplay takes only the character names from the classic short story "" the legend of sleepy hollow .
"" in the movie ichabod crane ( johnny depp ) is a new york city police constable who is trying to introduce scientific methods of investigation to his superiors .
ichabod is dispatched to the small town of sleepy hollow to investigate a series of murders .
several of the town 's leading citizens have been decapitated by the headless horseman .
although he rejects the ghost story the town elders tell him , ichabod finds that the facts of the case confound his scientific reasoning .
he also discovers that the killings are not random , that the victims are tied together by a secret .
along the way ichabod gets help from a bewitching ( literally ) young woman ( christina ricci ) and the son of one of the murder victims ( marc pickering ) .
my reaction : ho - hum
.
the plot is an accumulation of cliches without even the slightest touch of originality to make it interesting .
that in itself is forgivable ; hollywood constantly tries to sell us used products in new packages .
however , burton 's attempts at inducing fright come off as goofy .
it might be his background -- in his previous movies , goofy was the goal .
along the same lines , it does n't help that creature designer ( and producer ) kevin
yagher has done his best work for the tongue - in - cheek tales from the crypt tv series .
a witch 's eyes and tongue shoot out like roger rabbit 's , a tree spurts blood like it 's in a monty python sketch , and
the headless horseman .
. .
well , he 's a guy without a head .
.
.
on a horse
( boo ! ) .
the performances are also awful .
although he 's impressed me with his work in other films , depp does n't seem to know what to do with ichabod , and his dialogue is hampered by stilted diction
that 's supposed to pass for an 18th century accent .
ricci seems to put all her effort into seeming enigmatic , which guarantees that we wo n't sympathize with her character .
the actor who is revealed at the end to be the villain comes off as ridiculously cartoonish .
the only pleasure generated by the cast comes from surprise cameos by christopher lee , martin landau , and christopher walken .
i wonder if this movie was originally conceived as part of francis ford coppola 's projected series of gothic adaptations , a series that produced only "" bram stoker 's dracula "" and "" mary shelley 's frankenstein .
""
coppola is an executive producer for "" sleepy hollow , "" and the script reflects his interest in early forms of "" moving pictures , "" particularly in a toy that ichabod carries which blends two pictures to create an optical illusion .
( there 's a bird on one side of the card , a cage on the other .
when the card is flipped rapidly , the bird appears to be caged . )
bottom line : the hollow is n't the only thing that 's sleepy .",0,"['ho - hum', 'the performances are also awful', ""does n't seem to know what to do"", 'i left disappointed', ""it does n't help"", 'ridiculously cartoonish', 'his dialogue is hampered by stilted diction', ""we wo n't sympathize with her character"", '( boo ! )', 'an accumulation of cliches without even the slightest touch of originality']"
"by trying to satisfy every kind of viewer , it 's possible that sphere may end up pleasing no one .
action lovers will be bored by what they will see as an interminably boring setup .
audience members who crave more intellectual fare will be disgusted by the film 's sudden collapse into mindless storytelling and by the ending , which is an insulting cop - out .
somewhere out there , maybe there 's a small cadre of film - goers who will appreciate sphere 's dubious charms , but i 'm not among them .
i sincerely hope the novel is better than the movie ( i no longer read anything by either michael crichton or john grisham ) , because if the finished motion picture product is anything to go by , it 's hard to understand why the rights were optioned .
sphere is the kind of first- class mess that only a top - line director with an a - list cast can create .
with expectations high ( and how could they not be , considering that another barry levinson / dustin hoffman collaboration , the excellent wag the dog , is still playing in theaters ? ) , something this bad ca n't help but look even worse
.
the last time a big - name , big - budget film displayed this level of ineptitude was last year 's batman & robin , and everyone knows how that movie was received .
sphere starts out a little like an amalgamation of contact and james cameron 's the abyss , but , somewhere along the way ,
it collapses into the cellar with another recent science fiction effort , event horizon .
science and philosophy , which are used to good effect during sphere 's first hour , give way to mindless , confusing action sequences .
attempts at characterization fall apart .
intelligent writing , which is evident early on , is replaced by hackneyed drivel .
special effects take over as the plotline devolves into incoherent silliness .
but all that is just in preparation for the ending , which is inexcusably awful .
this is the time - honored deus ex machina device used to its worst effect .
i left the theater feeling cheated by the way crichton and his screenwriters had chosen to end the film .
there is some promise , but it 's all in the setup .
we 're introduced to norman goodman ( dustin hoffman ) , a psychologist who once wrote a $ 35 , 000 report for the government about what to do in the event that a crashed space ship is discovered .
when one is found in the middle of nowhere , 1000 feet below the surface of the pacific ocean , norman is called in to be part of the welcoming committee .
on the team with him are beth halperin ( sharon stone ) , a biochemist who was once his student and lover ; harry adams ( samuel l . jackson ) , a mathematician who earned his first doctorate at the age of 18 ; ted fielding ( liev schreiber ) , an astrophysicist who is awed by the opportunity to explore alien technology ; and harold barnes ( peter coyote ) , the government operative in charge of the mission .
together , the five descend into the bowels of the ocean , where they rendezvous with a temporary sea base on the ocean floor from which they will attempt to make first contact .
for a while , sphere had me fooled into thinking it was going to take an astute approach to the man - meets - alien situation .
the overall scenario is not without promise and several plot twists ( such as the revelation that the enormous craft is actually an american space ship , apparently from the future ) offer intriguing possibilities .
then , right around the one - hour mark ( that 's the time to sneak into the theater next door and check out whatever 's left of titanic ) , the virtually non - stop action begins , and , once it starts ,
the script becomes superfluous .
this might be acceptable if director levinson generated some legitimate tension , but ,
instead , he relies on loud , overbearing music , strange camera angles , and quick cuts to make things "" exciting .
"" additionally , because none of the characters are well - formed ( a common failing in anything penned by crichton , who 's more interested in technology than people ) , viewers do n't develop much of a rooting interest .
it makes sitting through sphere a frustrating and pointless experience .
what about that a - list cast ? not surprisingly , the most energetic performance is given by samuel l . jackson , but his harry is n't a person ; he 's a walking plot device spouting occasionally - witty dialogue .
dustin hoffman is n't lively or particularly good -- it 's ironic that this , which may be his worst work in a decade , has arrived in theaters on the heels of his best actor nomination ( for wag the dog ) .
sharon stone and peter coyote are both flat .
their characters exhibit little evidence of emotion ; automatons would have been as effective .
then there 's queen latifa , who , despite getting fifth billing in the credits ( ahead of liev schreiber , who boasts at least quadruple her screen time ) , has less than a handful of lines and almost nothing to do other than inflate the body count .
i like to think that levinson and hoffman , recognizing how uninspired this movie was likely to be , chose to make wag the dog as a sort of penance ( the low - budget picture was filmed during sphere 's lengthy pre - production phase ) .
if that 's the case , forgiveness is granted .
i 'm less inclined to look favorably upon crichton , although he has a few enjoyable titles on his resume ( jurassic park and the levinson - directed disclosure come to mind ) .
even if his novel was butchered in the adaptation process , crichton 's credit as a producer disallows him absolution .
he was a willing participant in a creative travesty .
no wonder sphere is being released in february , in the midst of the early year 's cinematic wasteland .
it deserves no better than to get sunk by the unstoppable titanic , which should plow sphere under on its way to a ninth - consecutive weekend atop the box office heap .",0,"['used to its worst effect', 'exhibit little evidence of emotion ; automatons would have been as effective', ""no wonder sphere is being released in february , in the midst of the early year 's cinematic wasteland . it deserves no better than to get sunk"", 'i left the theater feeling cheated', ""will be disgusted by the film 's sudden collapse into mindless storytelling and by the ending , which is an insulting cop - out"", 'are both flat', 'the script becomes superfluous', 'the kind of first- class mess', 'the plotline devolves into incoherent silliness', 'mindless , confusing action sequences . attempts at characterization fall apart', ""he 's a walking plot device spouting occasionally - witty dialogue"", ""is n't lively or particularly good -- it 's ironic that this , which may be his worst work in a decade"", 'inexcusably awful', 'instead , he relies on loud , overbearing music , strange camera angles , and quick cuts to make things "" exciting .

"it has happened again .
a movie that is well scripted , well acted , and well directed .
it is involving , suspenseful . . .
it even has an unexpected twist at the end
that packs a punch like a blow to the solar plexus .
but in order to accept its premise one must also accept a spiritual lie .
the sixth sense is that movie .
starring bruce willis ( armageddon ) as a child psychologist and haley joel osment ( forrest gump ) as a troubled youngster , the sixth sense is more spooky than scary , though it does contain disturbing images designed to startle .
eight - year - old cole sear ( osment ) sees dead people .
not just in dreams .
and not just as lifeless bodies .
he sees them walking around like regular people .
and he sees them all the time .
dr .
malcolm crowe ( willis ) is trying to help him .
he recognizes in cole many of the same attributes as one of his earlier patients whom crowe failed , resulting in that patient shooting crowe before turning the gun on himself .
if crowe could manage to find a way to help cole , he believes he just might be able to put his own demons to rest .
but first he needs to gain cole 's trust .
the boy is so frightened by what he sees , he has closed himself off emotionally , being unwilling to tell anyone . . .
not crowe , not even his own mother ( toni collette , clockwatchers ) . . .
about his "" secrets .
"" crowe begins to spend more and more time with him , even as his own marriage starts to dissolve around him , his wife anna ( olivia williams , rushmore ) becoming cold and distant because of his neglect of her and his preoccupation with the boy .
bruce willis underplays his role , allowing the excellent script to do most of the work of building character development .
crowe moves from treating a troubled boy who wo n't communicate , to treating a troubled boy who is having hallucinations , to wondering if perhaps there is n't some truth behind what the boy sees .
mr .
willis does a serviceable job , letting the focus remain on the story instead of on his familiar action hero screen persona .
eleven - year - old haley joel osment manages to impress us with his performance .
he demonstrates an amazing amount of self - composure as well as an ability to play nuances in a complex character
as if he were a seasoned pro .
it is fine work
for one of such a tender age .
keep your eye on this young man .
the supporting cast is also quite effective .
toni collette , as the confused , frightened , and frustrated mother who ca n't understand what is happening to her child ; olivia williams , as crowe 's once loving wife who is shutting down emotionally due to the lack of attention from her husband ; and donnie wahlberg ( ransom ) as crowe 's ex - patient , now grown , who illustrates his doctor 's failure to help him in the most vivid terms imaginable .
twenty - eight year old m . night shyamalan ( wide awake ) directed his own script , maintaining a proper tension throughout the film and crafting the storytelling so expertly that the film 's full impact is not reached until its final moments , when a surprising revelation forces a reevaluation of all that preceded it .
it is a rare movie which manages to pull that off and mr . shyamalan , as the one responsible , is certainly to be commended .
in giving the sixth sense a favorable "" three star "" review for its craftsmanship and artistic merit , i must also point out that , spiritually speaking , the film is highly misleading .
there is no scriptural foundation upon which to base a belief in ghosts or the "" living dead .

the concept of death being a doorway to another plane of existence is a devilish lie that has been around as long as man himself .
the first lie recorded in the bible was devised by the serpent who assured eve , "" thou shall not surely die , "" a direct contradiction of god 's admonition .
that same lie has been perpetuated ad infinitum throughout the ages .
scriptures do speak of a time when the dead shall rise but that wonderful demonstration of victory over death will not commence until after the second coming of christ .
. .
an event which has not yet occurred .
therefore , the dead remain in a state of oblivion , having no consciousness , until that long - awaited time when the final trump shall sound .
and then , you 'll need six senses to register all the joy and rejoicing that will resound throughout the heavens .",1,"['it is a rare movie', 'maintaining a proper tension throughout the film and crafting the storytelling so expertly', 'well scripted , well acted , and well directed . it is involving , suspenseful . . . it even has an unexpected twist at the end', 'quite effective', 'certainly to be commended', 'as if he were a seasoned pro . it is fine work', 'craftsmanship and artistic merit', 'manages to impress us with his performance . he demonstrates an amazing amount of self - composure', 'the excellent script']"
"george little ( jonathan lipnicki ) wants a little brother .
after mr .
and mrs .
little ( hugh laurie and geena davis ) visit the orphange , they decide to adopt stuart , a talking mouse ( voiced by michael j . fox ) .
george is n't so fond of his new brother when stuart arrives at the little house , and neither is snowbell the family cat ( voiced by nathan lane ) .
george and stuart eventually bond while preparing for a remote control boat race , but snowbell wants stuart out of the house ( he 's unable to live with the taunts of other neighborhood felines saying it 's ridiculous that a mouse has a pet cat ) .
stuart little is a mix of live action and computer generated imagery ( cgi ) .
the character of stuart , while obviously a computer generated image , grows on you as the film progresses and you 'll soon see him as much more than a mere special effect
.
there is also a great deal of animal training involved with this film , as many of the "" supporting cast "" are actual cats ( with computer animated mouths so they can speak ) .
it 's fascinating to watch these cats give performances without an actual mouse to interact with .
stuart little is a charming family film .
there are some great laughs in the movie ( with a script co - written by the sixth sense 's m . night shyamalan no less ! ) , some moments that can only be described as "" too cute "" ( the boat race sequence is what won me over ) and even the majority of the one - liners ( common nowadays in children 's films or films featuring nathan lane ) are tolerable .
kids and parents will love this one .
stuart little is available on dvd from columbia tristar home video .
there are two different dvds on sale : one contains the film in full frame , and the other presents the film in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 .
66 : 1 . both versions feature choices of either dolby surround or dolby digital 5 .
1 audio .
both versions also contain the following extras ( and hang in there with me here . . .
there 's a lot of them ) :
a full length audio commentary track by director rob minkoff and animation supervisor henry anderson , a full length audio commentary track by the visual effects supervisors , an isolated score track , an interactive trivia game , an interactive featurette that goes step by step through eight of the effects in the film , a making of documentary that originally aried on hbo , and a stuart little read - along story ( which you can read yourself or have stuart read for you ) .
there are also three music videos , and six theatrical trailers ( called thecatrical trailers . . . get it ?
it 's funny ! )
for stuart little and five other columbia tristar releases : the adventures of elmo in grouchland , madeline , the nuttiest nutcracker , muppets from space , and baby geniuses ( the only bad thing about this entire dvd .
. .
i did not want to be reminded of the awfulness that is baby geniuses ) .
dvd - rom features are also on the disc , including web links and a demo of the stuart little cd - rom game .
but wait . . .
there 's still more !
there 's a section called "" basement treasures "" where you will find the auditions of the film 's animators , six deleted scenes which you can select to view with or without commentary from the director , a visual effects gag reel , a production gag reel , and an incredible eight minute storyboard sequence detailing the original concept for the boat race scene ( with commentary from the director ) .
the first commentary track features director rob minkoff and animation supervisor henry anderson .
they give insightful and detailed thoughts about the film 's production .
minkoff likes to point out scenes where other screenwriters came in and polished up the script , namely writers like scott alexander and larry karaszewski ( who wrote the people vs .
larry flynt and ed wood ) and lowell ganz and babaloo mandel ( who wrote splash and multiplicity , among others ) .
anderson is very appreciative of the animators who worked with him and often points out which animator worked on each scene as they occur .
the second commentary track features visual effects supervisors john dykstra and jerome chen who discuss more specific details of the effects in the film .
movie fans will enjoy the informative first commentary track , serious animation buffs will love the second one .
now i know this is slightly off topic , but it is related specifically to this dvd
so i must voice this now .
one of the music videos on the disc is for a song called "" i need to know "" by a group called r angels .
this video features four mid - teenage girls ( the singers obviously ) having a slumber party .
the girls ask a ouija board "" i need to know . . . who to do , who to do , who to do "" as the song begins .
they then sneak out of their house , and along the way they strike a pose and their slumber party pajamas are magically transformed into middle class streetwalker outfits .
then they head to a party and dance suggestively with the guys while singing lyrics like "" i 'll be your pleasure all the time .
. .
just say the words that you 'll be mine "" .
um . . .
what the hell ?
what does this have to do with stuart little ?
how is this in any way a song suitable for a kids movie , let alone a video suitable for a kids movie on dvd ?
when the video concludes , the words "" to be continued "" appear .
oh i ca n't wait to see who they 've slept with when the toy story 2 dvd comes out .
kids wo n't care about most of the special features on this dvd , but those of us who can sometimes be turned into a "" kid at heart
"" thanks to a winning family film sure appreciate them .
this is the way to do dvd , a good movie loaded with great features at a reasonable cost .
the di$ney people could learn a lot from columbia tristar .",1,"['a good movie loaded with great features', 'is a charming family film', 'some great laughs', ""it 's fascinating to watch"", ""grows on you as the film progresses and you 'll soon see him as much more than a mere special effect"", 'kids and parents will love this one', 'thanks to a winning family film sure appreciate them']"
"one of the funniest carry on movies and the third with a medical setting .
the main story is about dr .
james nookey ( jim dale ) who is disliked by his superiors , frederick carver , head of the hospital ( kenneth williams ) , and dr .
ernest stoppidge ( charles hawtrey ) who seems to dislike everyone .
they attempt to cause him as much trouble in the hospital as possible and all the blame is laid on nookey .
carver learns of a possible job opportunity from wealthy ellen moore ( joan sims ) on a distant tropical island and gets nookey trannsferred there .
when nookey arrives at this island , he meets gladstone screwer ( sid james ) who has lived on the island just about all his life .
screwer is in possession of a wonderful slimming drug made from natural ingredients .
dr .
nookey returns with the drug to england and sets up a new slimming business with ellen moore 's financial backing .
however , nookey and moore face opposition from screwer who goes to england to cash in on the drug , and carver and stoppidge who want to know the ingredients to create a rival drug .
the performances are all very commendable .
sid james has a slightly ambiguous character to play this time and he excels in his role .
kenneth williams , as usual , plays the unpopular and cunning head of the hospital .
joan sims is entertaining as the wealthy benefactor and jim dale should really head the cast with his excellent portrayal of bumbling nookey .
charles hawtrey plays an ' out - of - character ' role as dr .
stoppidge , the nasty and evil practitioner who wants to knock nookey off his perch .
some critics have said that this combination of hawtrey and stoppidge does not work well , but i think that it at least gives hawtrey a new part to play instead of the usual dimwit characters .
as a matter of fact , hawtrey is suitably cunning in the part .
other regulars in the movie include hattie jacques as the matron yet again ( but this part is probably her most boring ' matron ' ) and barbara windsor as nookey 's love interest and unofficial ' women 's lib ' campaigner , goldie locks .
both jacques and windsor play their parts well
.
patsy rowlands appears briefly as miss fosdick , and there are very small cameos from wilfrid brambell ( from ' steptoe and son ' fame ) and peter butterworth .
the jokes are mostly very funny , the story is quite appealing , and the regulars seem interested in what they 're doing .
although it is another medical carry on movie and some of the jokes are borrowed from previous movies , it still comes out on top
( it is the best medical carry on ) because of the above factors .
a must - see carry on movie .",1,"['the jokes are mostly very funny , the story is quite appealing', 'one of the funniest carry on movies', 'a must - see carry on movie', 'it still comes out on top', 'the performances are all very commendable', 'excels in his role', 'play their parts well']"
"one fun activity for parents during the holidays is to suggest an old film and see if they can interest their kids .
although black - and - white films are frequently viewed as suspect , ones in color are greeted with more of an open mind .
and if you can find a colorful action film , even if it is from six decades ago , then there is a real possibility of a take home hit .
so it was in our family when we wandered over to the classic section of our local video store the other day and picked up a copy of the adventures of robin hood , a high spirited version of the walter scott story .
nominated for the 1938 academy award for best picture and winner of three oscars for erich wolfgang korngold 's melodramatic music , ralph dawson 's
fast paced editing and carl jules weyl 's lush sets
, the film is probably best remembered for errol flynn 's charismatic acting as sir robin of locksley , a .
k .
a . robin hood .
flynn , with his handsome figure and toothy smile , charms the audience while clearly having a high old time himself .
let me cut to the chase and say that the tape was indeed popular in the rhodes household .
the littlest rhodes , jeffrey , age 8 , liked it so much that he viewed it at least three times and maybe more .
i 'll let him discuss his fascination with the picture in his usual section at the end of the review .
simply stated , the film derives its success from being one of the best of its genre , the swashbuckler .
robin , with a smile from ear - to - ear , fights off a hundred men without a scratch .
although the picture can be considered as little more than a 1930 's james bond ,
the production values and the acting raise it above that level
.
robin hood is a classic story of rich and poor .
robin steals from the rich and gives to the poor as every schoolchild knows .
in this movie , however , he seems much less interested in income redistribution than in fighting for his king and country .
robin , with his courage and athletic skills , serves as a role model for kids .
and with the lovely olivia de havilland playing the dreamy - eyed lady marian fitzswalter , the story has heavy romantic overtones .
filmed in the typical , richly oversaturated colors produced by early technicolor , the flesh tones are overly pink and there few color subtleties , which match perfectly the wonderfully exaggerated acting of the players .
in scene after scene the picture charms the audience . who would n't fall for robin as he shows up incognito to win the archery contest , even if the outcome is so clearly preordained .
and , of course , he does n't just win , he does so by splitting the other man 's arrow .
watching the picture today does provide some jarring moments .
sherlock holmes as the villain , sir guy of gisbourne , for example , just does n't seem right , even if basil rathbone did have a real - life identity outside of his most famous role .
and then there are those wigs from the makeup department -- so bad , they look like rejects from a mel brooks comedy .
as was popular in the cinema of that era , people die with the most gentle prick of the sword and without any nasty , bloody holes to spoil the wardrobe or the looks .
bad guys are banished rather than killed , and lovers go off hand - in - hand , doing nothing more explicitly sexual than kissing .
the result is a wonderful fairy tale of a movie with delightful , cartoonish figures .
hollywood rarely makes such high quality family films like this anymore , so try to savor the old ones when you can .
the adventures of robin hood runs 1 : 42 .
it is not rated , but containing absolutely nothing offensive , it would get a g rating and is fine for all ages .
jeffrey thinks the film is "" great "" and gives it

he recommends the movie particularly for people who do not likely bloody pictures -- he hates the sight of blood in movies .
his favorite parts are the battles and the ending , and his favorite characters are robin and king richard ( ian hunter ) .",1,"['lush sets', 'fast paced editing', 'thinks the film is "" great ""', 'melodramatic music', 'the production values and the acting raise it above that level', 'nominated for the 1938 academy award for best picture and winner of three oscars', 'the wonderfully exaggerated', 'handsome figure and toothy smile , charms the audience while clearly having a high old time himself', 'charismatic acting', 'he recommends the movie', 'the picture charms the audience', 'derives its success from being one of the best of its genre', 'a wonderful fairy tale of a movie with delightful , cartoonish figures . hollywood rarely makes such high quality family films like this anymore', 'liked it so much']"
"there should be a requirement that a potential viewer be under a certain film iq in order to see "" mission to mars .
""
there are probably quite a few people who are going to enjoy it , and most of them will probably be those who have seen very few films of its kind .
but there are those who will not , and those will most likely be people who have already seen one or more of the following movies :
"" 2001 : a space odyssey , "" "" armageddon , "" "" apollo 13 , "" "" the abyss , "" "" close encounters of the third kind , "" "" e .
t .
the extra - terrestrial , "" "" alien , "" and "" aliens .
"" why ? because
there is not one original idea in "" mission to mars .
""
all of it is cribbed from other films ( and in most cases , better films ) .
if this is the sort of thing you do n't mind , you might like the film .
of course , there are other reasons not to like "" mission to mars , "" the main one being a script written by people who seem to assume their audience is filled with people who have n't used their brains in some time , and who do n't intend to start during the film 's running time .
"" mission to mars "" manages to be both stupid and boring at the same time .
the plot , cribbed greatly from "" 2001 , "" concerns a team sent to mars , the first manned trip ever made to the red planet .
luke graham ( don cheadle ) leads the team , jointly formed of americans and russians .
the team encounters a mysterious monolith that emits a strange pulse ( this being nothing like the pulse - emitting monolith in "" 2001 "" -- that one was on the * moon * ) , but when they try to study it , a giant sand tornado comes out of the top and swallows them ( all except luke , who survives long enough to send a garbled message back to the rotating space station , which looks strangely like the rotating space station in "" 2001 "" ) . a rescue mission is planned with husband & wife team woody blake ( tim robbins ) and terri fisher ( connie nielsen ) , obligatory pilot with a troubled past jim mcconnell ( gary sinise ) , and extra crew member phil ohlmyer ( jerry o'connell ) along for the ride .
after some zero - gravity dancing , they run into problems when one of their engines is blown , forcing them to attempt a desperate landing aboard a supply vessel .
now stranded on mars with minimal supplies , the team must decide whether or not it can risk entering the monolith or if they should return home .
after all , that monolith just might contain information about how life originated on earth .
"" mission to mars "" is one of those films that makes a critic wonder where to start when talking about all the things that are wrong with it , so let 's start with one of the things that does work : director brian de palma manages to create some eerie tension in a few scenes during the middle of the film .
that 's it .
everything else fails .
the failure is n't de palma 's fault ; he 's working from an atrocious script .
only during the sequence aboard the ship ( looking an awful lot like the jupiter vessel in "" 2001 "" ) where the rescue team 's air begins running out and they must frantically search for the hole and patch it up does "" mission to mars "" come to life .
a scene where they attempt to save a comrade floating away into space also provides some tension , until you realize that the entire danger / more danger / attempted rescue sequence has absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the film ; it 's just a contrived way to generate thrilling scenes .
take it out , and the plot is n't affected in any way .
the sequence also suffers from a few plot holes
( as does the rest of the film ) : why is the ship 's computer ( which sounds strangely like hal from , uh , "" 2001 "" ) able to detect a hole in the main chamber but not one in the engine ?
why did tim robbins ' character have to go outside the ship when the solution easily presented itself from inside ?
should n't the astronauts be better trained to deal with a hull breach ?
why are the characters such idiots ?
because the script makes little attempt to properly develop them .
all the "" conflict "" is clumsily delivered in excruciatingly obvious exposition in the opening scene ( which rips off orson welles and robert altman by utilizing a long opening tracking shot ) during which the characters repeatedly tell each other about things all of them should already know : "" jim , it 's too bad you ca n't go on this mission because you were determined ' psychologically inadequate ' because your wife died right before you were to go on the mission together
"" -- does anyone really talk like this ?
ca n't we find out these things in a less grating matter , like maybe in a flashback ?
the whole film is like that .
the filmmakers are not content to merely show us something and assume we know what 's going on ; they must * tell * us exactly what we 're looking at * every * time .
sample dialogue from the film : ( shot of mars ) astronaut
a : "" look , there 's mars "" astronaut b :
"" you sure that 's mars ?
"" astronaut a :
"" yeah , that 's mars all right .
"" astronaut c :
"" hey , are you guys looking at mars ?
"" that exchange is n't actually in "" mission to mars , "" but i would n't be surprised if it were .
for all their cribbing from kubrick , spielberg , james cameron , and even ron howard , the makers of this film have n't learned to do something all those directors did very well :
show and do n't tell .
de palma used to know how , but seems to have forgotten .
this is mentally - challenged filmmaking ; they assume the audience wo n't get what 's going on , so they explain everything five times over .
fourth - graders may appreciate this , but more learned viewers will have their intelligence insulted .
the principal actors sleepwalk their way through "" mission to mars , "" never managing to do away with an apparent "" i 'm just here to get a paycheck "" attitude .
cheadle stumbles over his awkward lines .
armin mueller - stahl manages to thoroughly embarrass himself in an unbilled cameo .
robbins puts his game face on and phones in his standard "" decent guy "" performance . and sinise hams it up with "" wistful "" facial expressions while watching tapes of his dead wife ( played by kim delaney , who only has one scene during which she still manages to deliver some ridiculous dialogue in a heavy - handed monologue about the meaning of life ) , and especially during the stolen - from - no - less - than - three - movies ( a lollipop to whoever names them ) conclusion , which combines endless , obvious explanation and sub - par cgi effects with gagging sentimentality and is sure to alienate any viewers who had been enjoying the show up until then .
and of course , these aliens from mars who facilitated the evolution of life on earth are entirely different from the aliens in "" 2001 "" who facilitated the evolution of life on earth ; those aliens were from an * unknown * world .
it could be said that fans of brainless action films might enjoy "" mission to mars , "" but such a comment ignores the fact that the film is also incredibly slow - going .
leisurely pacing might have helped a film with a little more substance to it , but all of the substance of "" mission to mars "" has been stolen from other films , and those other films dealt with their ideas in a much more thoughtful fashion and generally contained more engaging characters .
supposedly we 're intended to choke up when one character decides not to return home at the end of this one ( totally different from the one - character - decides - not - to - return ending of "" armageddon "" ) , but i suspect most people will either be laughing or groaning .
me , i alternated between the two .
there is only one good thing about the way "" mission to mars

"while the summer movie season approached its long awaited cessation , we had yet another shoddy , subordinate disposable celluloid superhero movie brought on by the inexorable hasten from the major studios to please kids with everything they think kids will go for to disburse their seven bucks .
and , once again , we have one of the worst films of the year .
the trend of the moment-- and bear in mind
it 's a trend not a movie - is spawn , and if you 've seen the animated series on hbo you 'll recall it embodies the lost life of a disfigured man , an individual who has transpired the ultimate punishment : he 's been sent to hell .
todd mcfarlane , the creator of the spawn comic book , must have had a tough time sitting through spawn , for his creativity and themes about resurrection and loss of identity were all being jettisoned in favor of reliable special effects , style over substance , ambience over anything else .
not only does spawn rely entirely on special effects , the story , about a bewildered individual who must take on a group of * bad guys * and * find himself * in the process is realized in such a sordid , incapable manner , it becomes indigestible after a while .
every character in this film is lifeless , vacuous and seemingly written by a depressed college student .
the story begins , like in every superhero movie in this age , with a man living an idyllic life .
al simmons ( michael jai white ) , a government agent / assassin shares the love of his wife , wanda ( theresa russell ) and daughter , has a tongue - in - cheek , wiseass partner , terry ( d . b sweeney ) and is content with the job his boss , jason wynn ( martin sheen ) , provides him .
the next element in the film is the part when things go awry .
and as expected , everyone turns the tables on poor al .
as the two are investigating their latest mission at some sort of biological weapons plant , al is befriended by jason , and dies in a gory and truly sickening scene .
inevitably , it leads everyone to the conclusion that he has passed away .
hence , jason 's mischievous master - mind plan , to ` conquer the world "" is just commencing its initial stages , when al makes a pact with satan himself , agreeing to command the devil 's army to take over the world and he gets to see his family again .
so , our pal al has been uplifted to hell , and while his transformation from normal guy to spawn takes place , his ol' partner terry forms a relationship with his wife .
time passes .
and now spawn is present in the grotesque inner city , the ghetto where cog ( nicol williamson ) teaches
spawn how to utilize his neat artifacts , his motorbike , armor , etc . . .
this character is merely a poor man 's obi wan kenobi without all the mythological hoopla
.
now the stage is set spawn , the new ` enemy of evil ' vs evil . and evil takes the cake , doubtlessly .
john leguizamo 's deliciously heinous performance as the injurious clown working for wynn is the film 's relief point .
all this anguish , pain , half - baked themes and putrid action scenes are invisible to leguizamo , who steals the show and derives joy from his character , which is basically a compilation of so - so one liners .
and then there 's martin sheen .
whichever way you look you will find carving boards near his pitying and downright appalling last two years .
his selections calls for an immediate firing of his agent .
as the megalomaniac boss , his caricature plays like a bad dream out of a b - movie , scrambled , and left in the shelf to rot .
this is the man that starred in films such as apocalypse now and wall street .
i 'd never thought i 'd be saying this , but at this juncture , charlie sheen 's career is in better shape .
spawn is a movie in which realism , or even an attempt to draw a parallel between the problems of the hero and real life is identifiable .
for most of the film the vapid michael jai white consumes
his time ogling , jumping through roofs , and performing all kinds of acrobatic exercises which even batman and robin accomplished better .
it constantly reminded us we were watching a superhero movie-- a very bad superhero movie
.
continually the film kept on depending on special effects , and sadly
, this is how pictures are being made .
perhaps no other movie better than spawn illustrates the deterioration of cinema through computer wizardry .
the filmmakers seem to have forgotten every human element possible .
the quality of this film is abysmal and insulting .
it is perceptible that director mark dippe , attempted to touch the psychological chord that tim burton 's batman did touch , the desperation of a man whose life has all but evaporated in one spontaneous act .
but bruce wayne had human elements to him .
he was pensive , resourceful and had relationships , which made our perspective on him equally human .
the character of al simmons seems to be longing for a drastic change , as if he 's fatigued about being normal .
and as all superheroes , batman , superman , the phantom , they must possess an element of normal civilians to make us think they are extraordinary .
none of this is present in spawn .
the fighting sequences are weakly executed , the dialogue is penny - dreadful and the art direction an odious duplicate of blade runner 's . as an example of this film 's vastly creative imagination the writers of spawn decided to include a poor orphan boy who is abandoned and beaten , and then rescued by spawn , so our emotions tend to be a little more sympathetic .
admittedly , i did laugh once in the film , and that 's when todd mcfarlane showed up in an unexpected cameo as a bum .
it is no wonder why so american children grow up with no engrossment for art or literature .
besides blaming a large portion of it on the laughable school system , i condemn the other part to garbage like spawn .
movies that present no admiration , no captivation , no richness and vague interest in what children are being subjected to .
and kids will continue to see films like spawn , simply because they are unable to differentiate what makes an imaginative , wondrous film from an insipid and wasteful one .
children are not muppets . and spawn unapologetically targets children .",0,"['yet another shoddy , subordinate disposable celluloid superhero movie brought on by the inexorable hasten', 'seem to have forgotten every human element possible . the quality of this film is abysmal and insulting', 'an insipid and wasteful one', 'an odious duplicate', 'lifeless , vacuous and seemingly written by a depressed college student', 'sadly', 'a very bad superhero movie', 'garbage', 'present no admiration , no captivation , no richness and vague interest', 'all this anguish , pain , half - baked themes and putrid', 'weakly executed', 'one of the worst films of the year', 'is realized in such a sordid , incapable manner , it becomes indigestible', 'basically a compilation of so - so one liners', ""this character is merely a poor man 's obi wan kenobi without all the mythological hoopla"", 'illustrates the deterioration of cinema', 'penny - dreadful']"
"a group of high school kids mix up with a group of hip - hop artists as a documentarian strives to discover why today 's youth seem attracted to black culture .
the review if black & white , the new film from writer / director james toback , is eventually remembered for only one thing , it will be the revelation that brooke shields , claudia schiffer ,
marla maples and mike tyson can act .
however , this partly improvised gem will be remembered for more than that .
black & white is a fascinating film
; it makes a statement about america 's youth and hip - hop culture without getting heavy - handed overly serious .
featuring a cast of known commodities ( ben stiller , robert downey jr . ) and hot newcomers ( singers bijou phillips ) , toback 's is a complex film worth seeing .
black & white has multiple storylines that are all related to each other , a la robert altman .
there is dean the basketball player ( allan houston ) who is asked to rig games for money by mark clear ( stiller ) in exchange for fifty grand a game .
this eventually spills over into the life of dean 's long - time friend rich ( power ) , a gangsta who controls 20 city blocks of harlem .
rich has to deal with the imminent opening of a white - owned club on his turf .
meanwhile , the young white girls who like to hang around with rich and his homies get talked into being in a documentary by sam donager ( shields ) and her gay husband terry ( downey jr . ) .
others who make appearances are william lee scott as the young white punk will , joe pantoliano as his district attorney father , jared leto as a high school teacher , marla maples as the mother of one of hip - hop crazed teens , claudia schiffer as dean 's girlfriend , and mike tyson as . . .
mike tyson .
the stories ebb and flow through the film , losing and gaining prominence over time .
friendships are lost , lovers are gained , and there is an occasional burst of violence .
originally rated nc-17 in the united states , black & white features a lot of sex between black gangstas and young white girls .
while the film was trimmed down to a tamer r rating , viewers will wonder what could be more explicit than what they are seeing .
the three - way sexual beginning of the film nicely warns viewers of what they are in for , and several audience members got up and left at that point .
the frequent sex is one of the film 's few flaws as the titillation is overdone and at times completely unrelated to anything else going on in the film .
to toback 's credit , the level of violence in black & white is almost nil .
these gangstas and hip - hop artists are given real problems and concerns , and only become gun - toting crazies when it benefits them to appear that way .
whenever a character finds himself on donager 's handheld digital camera , he starts spouting off righteous tirades on america and proclaims his independence , but not everyone has fully bought into the idea .
charlie ( phillips ) is full of bluster about why she loves hip - hop , but admits that "" in ten years time , i 'll be way over this .
""
these youth know they are going through a phase , and are simply enjoying it .
toback fills the spaces between these tirades with scenes that are lightweight and funny .
most of the humour comes from mike tyson , who provides the film 's comic relief without really trying .
he is given big words like vernacular to say , and as rich tries to discuss a particular street problem with tyson , he frequently has to ask him to use smaller words and explain himself better , playing on tyson 's image as a dimwit .
but tyson also gets the film 's scariest moment .
as he is mercilessly hit upon by the very gay terry , tyson is a marvel to watch as he fights to remain calm .
the scene is entirely improvised , with downey jr . being told to just keep at tyson until he gets a reaction .
the reaction he gets , being slapped and then choked is astonishing , as downey jr 's face turns a frightening shade of purple .
black & white is a film about hip - hop culture , and the film 's omnipresent hip - hop soundtrack strongly supports this .
but toback keeps things from becoming too serious ; by moving from story to story as quickly as he does , toback keeps us from becoming attached to any one character 's struggle .
thus black & white 's message about hip - hop becomes secondary to the film itself .
toback just wants us to have fun and maybe learn a little about hip - hop along the way .
and we do .",1,"['a fascinating film', 'scenes that are lightweight and funny']"
"movie reviewers have an obligation to see the good , the bad , and the despicable .
i originally wrote this review for my college newspaper back in ' 95 , but i wanted to re - write it because not all retro reviews should be about the classics .
we need to be warned about some truly awful films , too .
this picture was so bad
, it inspired the description for my 1/10 rating ( see ratings chart below ) .
the only thing saving it from a 0/10 rating is that being able to rent a movie like this is slightly less embarassing than renting a porno .
so , it does indeed have some plusses . . .
in fairness , elizabeth berkley is certainly worth seeing in the buff .
and her ability to whine and irritate us , even while nude , was appropriate in her role as selfish temptress nomi malone .
this character is not smart , not interesting , and ( deliberately ? ) far too annoying far too often .
like in 1998s "" bulworth "" , when the movie was over i did n't care one little iota about the main character .
at least warren beatty tried to make a statement with his dreary and overrated film , though .
"" showgirls "" is too stupid to make a statement .
some people claim that the story is based on the legendary "" all about eve "" of all things !
if exploitation expert joe eszterhas was half the screenwriter that joseph l . mankiewicz was , he 'd be . . .
well , he 'd be a good screenwriter .
instead , this project may have sunk his career .
he wrote the ( ha ha ! )
script and the usually reliable paul verhoeven directed .
the same team who created a good sex - film in 1992 ( "" basic instinct "" ) struck out here with their occasional violence , gratuitous x - rated sex scenes , and numerous ( and quite unnecessary )
lesbian overtones .
the predictable storyline revolves around nomi streaking into las vegas to make it big as a dancer .
after the supposed street - smart young "" lady "" gets conned out of her suitcase by a slack - jawed yokel in the opening sequence , she befriends a tailor of the glamorous stage production at the "" stardust hotel "" .
nomi does n't take advantage of this contact to break into the big - time of dirty dancing right away .
first , she becomes a lap dancer at a scummy strip club .
she sells her hot little wares at "" the cheetah "" for a short time , turning on the fictitious customers and the actual theatre audience .
hey , i never said she was n't a hot number .
. .
maybe it 's that , her body , which gets her into the big - time when the star of the "" stardust hotel "" , crystal connors ( gina gershon ) stops into the strip club ( it certainly is n't her brains or pleasant disposition ! ) .
crystal requests a private lap dance for her boyfriend ( kyle maclachlan ) .
he also happens to be the pleasure - seeking worm who runs the big show .
crystal gets nomi onto the "" stardust "" team and , after an interminable amount of time , nomi "" earns "" the role of crystal 's understudy .
the slut then deliberately injures and hospitalizes crystal .
it was almost laughable that nomi had the guts to claim that she 's "" not a whore "" .
that 's a phrase we hear a few different times and it 's completely ludicrous .
of course she is !
she sells her soul to make it big , but in the end we 're supposed to believe that she 's a better person than that .
we 're supposed to root for her .
no way !
she 's a tramp and a back - stabber who deserved nothing -- least of all vindication in the . . .
ahem .
. .
climax .
she is not a good person and they take over two hours to explain that the audience should think that she is .
the sub - plot with a male dancer ( glenn plummer ) who claims to see talent in nomi is just a gratuitous opportunity to let her dance naked a little bit more .
it sure ai n't character development !
plummer also appeared in "" speed "" in ' 94 in a smaller , yet better role .
this sub - plot goes absolutely nowhere except maybe to deliver an unsubtle hint that fornicators should practice birth control .
kyle maclachlan must have been promised a big pay - day or his standards have dipped since appearing in "" blue velvet "" .
that picture was weird , but some critics claim it 's one of the best movies of
the ' 80s .
now ol' kyle can say that he acted in one of the worst of the ' 90s , too .
his sleazy character is important to "" showgirls "" , but we do n't learn anything about him .
he uses people to get what he wants , but that only means that he fits in well with the other characters in this movie .
is he a villain ? who cares !
ultimately , this movie is as tiresome
as it is explicit .
everyone must know by now about the soft - core acts of copulation , especially the riotous romp between berkley and maclachlan in his pool .
what few reviewers take issue with is how mean - spirited this movie is .
everyone 's either having sex , exacting revenge , or wishing they were having sex or exacting revenge .
it 's just too hard to take ( especially for over two hours ) .
if we must be exposed to the evils of the vegas world , why could n't verhoeven have also made a point of highlighting the whispers , grunts , and other sounds during the dance numbers ?
it 's hard to care about these people if we ca n't even appreciate what they 're capable of doing on - stage .
berkley may have a future in hollywood because she can dance and she has a great body .
after all , the world of porn is still an active , dishonourable profession .
perhaps berkley could join their ranks and leave the real acting to pauly shore and cindy crawford .
oops , they 're bad actors , too .
well , at least , they 're not selfish and contemptable like good ol' slutty nomi malone .

"come on hollywood , surprise me . stop giving us these poorly written thrillers with banal dialogue , sketchy characters and plots as predictable as the sunset .
the always watchable morgan freeman plays a detective who becomes personally involved in a case involving missing girls .
personal , because his niece is one of the victims .
it 's a slobbering psychopath , of course , but this time there 's a twist .
freeman notes that each of the young women who 've disappeared are all strong willed , assertive , and more successful in their careers than the average girl .
we soon learn that the guy calls himself casanova , whose aim is to "" dominate "" these modern gals by imprisoning them in some dungeon and keeping them as his personal harem .
anyway , one of the women manages to escape ( ashly judd ) and teams up with freeman to . . .
well , you know the rest .
a brief glance at the plot to silence of the lambs , with which this film is constantly being compared to by the hype merchants , may suggest lambs also has a fairly predictable story .
perhaps , but that film also has superbly drawn characters and smart dialogue .
so lets not insult a great movie by taking the comparisons any further ,
okay ?
and as for comparisons to seven . . .
oh please ! kiss the girls is based on the novel by james patterson and written for the screen by one david klass .
maybe the novel was a stinker to start with , but
whatever the case , it 's the writing that 's clearly at fault here .
one , these characters have very little to say that 's engaging or interesting .
two , the script has no sense of humour .
three ,
while the notion of a psycho 's victims being smart , successful women is an interesting twist , the execution is n't even half as good as the idea .
thus , ashly judd comes across all out of focus , instead of being the heart of the story .
we ca n't feel her rage .
some atrociously written casual exchanges between her and several male characters are supposed to remind us that she 's the no - bullshit 90 's type , but these conversations barely register .
and as for freeman , kiss the girls is his second dog in a year : first chain reaction , now this .
for an actor of his calibre , this is most worrying .
young director gary fleder scored a hit a few years back with his quirky pulp fiction - esque things to do in denver when your dead .
but what can he do with material as resolutely mediocre as this ?
not much , and you can hardly blame him .
there 's a few well - staged chase scenes through the forest where the camera whirls , dives and jumps , and the effect is startling .
but the script is beyond rescue .
what hurts most is that hollywood continues to get away with serving up this tripe , safe in the knowledge that jaded audiences will lap it up .
complacency rules
: it 's been so long since we saw a mainstream american thriller that delivered juicy characters , real surprises and consistently sharp dialogue .
the only consolation for this viewer is that my ticket to the movie was a freebie , positive proof that the best things in life are n't free . . . . .",0,"['comes across all out of focus', 'this is most worrying', 'resolutely mediocre', 'oh please !', 'no sense of humour', 'these conversations barely register', 'his second dog', ""is n't even half as good as the idea"", 'the script is beyond rescue', ""it 's the writing that 's clearly at fault here"", 'these poorly written thrillers with banal dialogue , sketchy characters and plots as predictable as the sunset', 'atrociously written', ""have very little to say that 's engaging or interesting""]"

"ingredients : london gal , fate , true love , running joke about monty python 's spanish inquisition synopsis : american actress gwyneth paltrow with dark hair , playing a londoner ? believe it .
sliding doors is a love ' what if ' story .
the gimmick is that it 's really two stories : the film follows the life of helen ( gwyneth paltrow ) down two directions .
in the beginning , likeable gal ' helen ' ( gwyneth paltrow ) gets unexpectedly fired from her advertising job .
so she goes into the subway train station meaning to return home early to her apartment and
her sleeping live - in lover gerry ( john lynch )
.
helen does n't know it , but she is at a fateful junction in life :
1 ) if she enters through the sliding door of a london subway train her life takes one path with one future 2 ) if she stays on the platform her life takes another path with a different future .
the film shows what happens in both paths , switching back and forth between intertwined , parallel stories .
in story one , helen meets a charming and talkative monty python fan named james ( john hannah ) on the train .
arriving home early , she discovers that her live - in , gerry ( john lynch ) , is having sex with his former lover lydia ( jeanne tripplehorn ) .
this leads to a life where helen moves out .
helen 's winsome new friend james helps her recover from a broken heart , and encourages her to start her own business .
in story two , helen experiences a different fate .
she misses the train , never meets james , and does n't get home early enough to discover gerry 's infidelity .
in this new life , helen takes up odd menial jobs , and faces the constant sneaking suspicion that all is not right with her relationship with gerry .
will the truth of the heart finally work its way through a number of problems and setbacks in both scenarios ?
opinion : rejoice all ye monty python fans , gwyneth paltrow fans , and watchers of quirky romance flicks .
at last here 's proof that there 's still creativity in 1990s filmmaking .
sliding doors is refreshingly different from anything this year .
not only is it a well - acted , heartwarming film , but it 's also easily gwyneth paltrow 's best recent performance .
when helen ( paltrow ) screams that her unfaithful boyfriend is a ' shagging wanker , ' ( a british phrase better left untranslated ) she sounds like she knows what she 's talking about ! nor does sliding doors go overboard with formulaic true love or other stereotypes .
nobody scrambles around in danger , screaming , "" i will find you no matter what , my darling ! "" when helen finds herself on a boat in the starlight with james , she does n't take the easy way out and leap into his arms , since she 's supposed to be recovering from heartache . and handsome live - in boyfriend gerry is n't the stereotypical screen hunk ( either a stud or a snob ) .
instead he 's a nervous and indecisive , almost helpless hunk .
another example : when one of the protagonists lies wounded in a hospital , sliding doors gives us neither the ' hospital miracle ' nor a maudlin tragedy but surprises us with a third variation .
in other words , all of the characters seem non - stereotyped , human , and local .
there are minor inconveniences .
since sliding doors switches back and forth between two possible fates , it 's occasionally difficult to distinguish between the two .
distinguishing between the two stories is n't a problem in the scenes containing paltrow , who sports two different hairstyles .
but in scenes containing only lydia and gerry , who look the same in both stories , it 's slightly confusing .
also , quite a few snappy comebacks referring to american pop culture ( seinfeld , woody allen , etc . ) are spoken by the british characters .
but these seem slightly forced , given that the remaining dialogue is predominantly british slang .
possibly an attempt by the screenwriter to balance the british so that american audiences can feel more comfortable ?
sliding doors is a charming , quirky , original , happy romance with a little ' philosophy of fate ' thrown in .

"i think maybe it 's time for the batman series to be put to rest .
not only has the first two films ' unsettling insight into what it would really take for someone to make himself into a "" superhero "" been abandoned , but this one throws any lingering realism out the window and goes for all - out camp with few traces of the self - mocking restraint of the relatively light - hearted third installment .
let me give you an example : in the first scene of the movie , batman ( george clooney ) and robin ( chris o'donnell ) are summoned to a museum that has been literally turned to ice by mr .
freeze ( arnold schwarzenegger ) in an attempt to steal a diamond .
mr .
freeze 's thugs are armed with none other than hockey sticks , but this is no problem for our heroes : automatic skates shoot out of their shoes , at which point robin manages to get hold of a hockey stick , grabs the diamond , and stick - handles it through the museum .
i might have expected this from an airplane - style farce , but i do n't think that 's what this movie is supposed to be . after all , the previous three batman movies were actually fairly realistic by the standards of the superhero / action genre and kept the corny death - defying stunts to a minimum , while playing the obligatory cheesiness with at least some amount of irony .
not any more ; the list goes on and on in this one .
robin holds onto the outside of a flying rocket ship 30 , 000 feet high in the atmosphere , climbing in the door to save batman .
mr . freeze and poison ivy ( uma thurman ) leap from a skyscraper and survive by landing in a small pond .
a world dominating mad scientist lives in a fortress that seems to have been stolen from the old he - man cartoons .
my very favorite example is the scene in which batgirl ( alicia silverstone ) gets in a race with motorcycle thugs , during which they come up with the clever notion of dousing the road with gasoline and setting it on fire to distract her .
not bad , but would n't the police ( or maybe batman ? )
notice if the road was on fire ?
i knew gotham city was this crazy anarchic place ,
but . . . . it also seems that the creators of the batman movies are obeying some unwritten rule that there have to be more main characters and plot lines in each successive installment .
as if three protagonists and two villains were n't enough , batman and robin
further weighs itself down with an underdeveloped side story of the failing health of bruce wayne 's butler alfred ( michael gough ) , which might have seemed poignant if it was n't surrounded by so much silliness , as well as several scenes with elle macpherson as bruce 's girlfriend which serve no purpose other than to remind us that she is in the movie .
all this might be semi - excusable if the story were interesting and entertaining , but it is n't . in fact ,
it 's kind of boring
.
mr . freeze and poison ivy pale in comparison as villains to past baddies such as jack nicholson 's joker and danny devito 's penguin .
their evil plot is as predictable ( schwarzenegger actually pronounces the words , "" today gotham city , tomorrow the world ! "" ) as it is lame - brained
( did n't it ever occur to poison ivy that freezing the entire world would kill her precious plants too ? ) .
and robin 's constant challenging of batman
mostly just makes him look bull - headed and stupid and makes us wonder why batman ever would have taken him on as a partner in the first place .
strip away the stars , the fancy set design , and the status as a "" batman movie , "" and all you have here is another barely passable summer action flick .",0,"['further weighs itself down with an underdeveloped side story', 'mostly just makes him look bull - headed and stupid', 'lame - brained', 'so much silliness', ""it 's kind of boring"", 'this one throws any lingering realism out the window and goes for all - out camp', 'another barely passable']"
"when the mediums in question are video game and feature film , has there ever been a respective here - to - there transformation that achieved any ground higher than noodle - headed mediocrity ?
"" super mario bros . , "" "" street fighter "" and "" mortal kombat "" were silly stinkers all , and now the empty , execrable "" wing commander "" joins their lowly ranks . enduring this spectacularly bad bit of sci - fi , easily the worst of its kind , is like watching someone futz around with a video game for 100 minutes - that is to say , there 's little fun to be had when you 're not the one holding the joystick .
the movie , then , is a missed opportunity for director chris roberts , who created the original , groundbreaking pc incarnation of "" wing commander "" back in 1990 .
how an interactive brainchild so revered could end up such a cinematic pile of junk under the helm of the same guy is a head - scratcher .

it rips off the finest films of its genre , top gun and , in one scene , even those spiffy "" stereoscopic freeze "" gap commercials . set in 2654 , "" wing commander "" stars freddie prinze jr .
as a daredevil cosmos cowboy who hopes to be a great fighter pilot like his father before him .
along the way , he plays kissy - face with his stoic superior ( saffron burrows ) at the new galaxy hangout where he 's posted , comes to terms with bigots who resent him for his "" pilgrim "" heritage ( do n't ask ) , and goes on a top - secret mission involving the "" jump coordinates "" ( what , no death star plans ? ) of a nasty alien race known as the kilrathi .
or something like that .
given the immensely confusing activity , it 's hard to tell .
on the other hand , what 's easy to see is that "" wing commander "" is a big old mess .
the lame dialogue strains , filled with such original lines as "" do n't you die on me ! "" , "" battle stations ! ""
and repeated ( and frequently unanswered ) calls for a "" medic !
"" action sequences fizzle .
the character conflict garners unintentional giggles .
the sole source of suspense here is what these kilrathi creeps look like , as they 're kept out of view until the concluding 15 minutes .
imagine bearded siamese cats crossed with something from a ? 50s roger corman cheapie
and you 've got a good idea .
little but techno - babble happens for an hour , and then it 's as if "" wing commander "" tries to do too much at once ; when it appears as though the movie 's about to show signs of a pulse , it instead provides a hilarious touch of human drama culminating with a use for a bulldozer that has probably never been seen in this kind of space camp before .
matthew lillard , featured prominently in said sequence , is cast as prinze 's hotshot partner , and though the two are fine young actors -
recently paired in the hit "" she 's all that "" - they 're fighting more than otherworldly evil here .
rumor has it that "" wing commander "" was slated as a later - in - the - year release , bumped up to capitalize off this hot casting coup as well as the premiere of the new "" star wars : episode i
"" trailer .
but in my audience , there were no females present to make goo - goo eyes at prinze or lillard , and

"not since 1996 's shine , which starred geoffrey rush as pianist david helfgott , has a movie so defiantly laid bare the lives of world - class musicians .
in fact , if one were to watch these films together , it would almost certainly stand as a convincing argument that a life of music naturally leads to all varieties of social ills .
yet hilary and jackie , the sophomore effort from director anand tucker , has something more to say -- it softly but strongly explores the complex relationships of sibling rivalry and love in a very compelling tale .
emily watson and rachel griffiths are the leads in this tale , playing the sisters du pr ? .
both musicians from childhood , hilary ( griffiths ) is renowned flutist while jacqueline ( watson ) is easily as skilled on the cello .
the two comepete for and win many honors as children and as young women , both together and seperate .
their careers as musicians surpass and then bow to one another 's , and although their lives take very different paths -- hilary settles down to marriage and a family while rachel skips across the globe on a world concert tour -- they are bound together by their deep family love .
the performances of watson and griffiths are excellent in style and substance .
they contrast each other wonderfully , and
while watson 's portrayal of jackie du pr ? is at times eccentric and perhaps unsympathetic , both characters are charged with emotion .
the frank cottrell boyce script , which is based on the book by hilary and piers
du pr ?
, brings a great deal of depth to these characters as well .
the script is also to be commended for its well - polished dual nature .
cottrell boyce adopts a style which one might expect to see in a mystery thriller ( which was in fact the case with david koepp and robert towne 's script for mission : impossible ) and skillfully molds it to the story of two rising musicians on different courses to fame .
the latter parts of his script are controversial to say the least , and the rather depressing ending takes the wind out of an envigorating story .
some will leave this movie feeling disenfranchised .
nevertheless , hilary and jackie is a movie that reaches an upper echelon of contemporary cinema through solid fundamentals and is a decent watch all around .",1,"['excellent in style and substance', 'commended for its well - polished dual nature', 'brings a great deal of depth to these characters', 'skillfully molds it', 'wonderfully', 'a decent watch all around', 'charged with emotion']"
"in 1995 , brian singer and christopher mcquarrie dreamed up a simple concept : the audience is n't stupid .
from that , they went on and created the most plot - driven , intricately pieced movie in the last 25 years .
the result : the usual suspects , one hell of a movie that redefines the word plot twist .
the story is convoluted , and is really confusing to read , although easy to follow on screen .
special investigator kujan ( chazz palminteri ) grills "" verbal "" kint ( kevin spacey ) , a crippled con - man who is the lone survivor of an la boat explosion that claimed more than 20 victims .
kujan wants to confirm that his nemesis , the rogue cop keaton ( gabriel byrne ) , is actually dead .
kint relates the majority of the film in flashback , beginning with the fateful day when five shifty guys meet in a police - station lineup in new york city .
along with dour keaton , kint encounters cheerfully sociopathic mcmanus ( stephen baldwin ) , mordantly sarcastic hockney ( kevin pollak ) , and fenster ( benicio del toro ) , whose speech is virtually incomprehensible .
together they plot to steal a small fortune in gems from "" new york 's finest taxi service "" --crooked cops who provide escort service for visiting drug kingpins .
what follows is a shell - game of violence and betrayal , all hinging on the identity of a mysterious villain called keyser soze .
the film is brilliantly compact : its the shortest 90 minutes you 'll ever spend in a movie theater .
the cast is exceptional .
palminteri shines , he is brutally honest , a true cop , one who is going after the whole story because its there .
byrne is terrific ,
his brooding character , his seriousness is needed to supplement the hysteria of benicio del toro , who is a riot as fenster .
del toro is brilliant , his lines are a jumbled mess , you ca n't understand a word the man says , but it sure is damn funny .
baldwin is also very good
, he is careful , methodical , and cold , a chilling character with a nasty streak of hot - blooded sarcasm .
pollak is also terrific as usual , a very good character actor .
however , this will be forever known as the film that launched kevin spacey .
spacey is simply breathtaking , he is a force on screen , giving a magnetic performance
that jars the senses at the end of this twisting maze .
spacey 's performance will be remembered for years , for it is the best of his career , it may be the best supporting actor performance in the last 50 years .
verbal kint is a clever storyteller , weak , oppressed , and gleefully evil to the bone , yet pitiful , one who draws sympathy .
the film is a good one , a decent film until the last 10 minutes .
what this film boils down to is the greatest ending in cinematic history , for me at least .
the revelation of keyser soze , the closing gunfights ,
it is something wondrous .
you have to see this movie about 10 times to believe what they do .
kudos to mcquarrie and singer for giving the audience a delightful , fast - paced , furiously plot - driven movie with quirky characters , phenomenal acting , and some hilarious moments
stuck in the middle .
mcquarrie refuses to believe the audience is dumb .
without furnishing too many details , he concocts his story and lets it run , hoping the audience gets it at the end .
we do .
this might just be the finest cinematic puzzle ever created .
kudos also to singer and john ottman , who created the score .
they both create what is a true film - noir setting , carefully setting up this intricate puzzle until the final , jarring ending .
there are flaws : more questions raised than answers , lack of character development , and no strong female characters ( save one ) .
however , the plot , and that stunning ending , make up for all the flaws and more . if you have n't seen the movie , rent it .

"an experience like baby geniuses can have certain effects on an average moviegoer .
you may be scarred for life after seeing this petrified piece of garbage , which is so disarmingly horrible that it may cause you to ponder it 's hollywood existence .
when i think of the screenwriters behind this film , i picture a room full of monkeys .
the monkeys are pounding on their typewriters while scratching themselves .
all of the monkeys combine their efforts , hop in a cab and take the finished product downtown to director bob clark 's office .
the designated monkey explains the plot by jumping up and down on clark 's desk while flailing his arms and shrieking .
the director appears to be deep in thought , until he slams his fist down on the desktop and exclaims ` i love it ! ! ! '
the writing behind this project is embarrassing
.
for your amusement , i will explain the plot .
dr .
kinder ( kathleen turner ) and dr .
heep ( christopher lloyd ) are two of the cold - hearted executives at the baby geniuses institute , where peculiar studies are going on .
as the story goes , there is an ancient myth explaining that babies ( ages 2 and under ) know all the secrets of the world from previous life experiences .
when they move past this phase , they become like any other drooling toddler .
kinder and heep want to unlock the secrets using their test babies , namely little sylvester ( sly for short ) , who can break in or out of any given situation so efficiently that he would be right at home on the mission : impossible team .
there is so much crap derived from this premise , despite the fact it 's virtually identical to the plot in look who 's talking !
( a far superior film in any league ) .
you will be able to determine the quality of the film by examining the opening scene .
sylvester has broken out and managed to elude several security guards with his amazing intellect and kung - fu tactics .
question :
it 's obvious the babies are super - smart , but why are they able to fight like jackie chan ? ?
the adults in this film are furiously beaten by these youngsters in diapers .
it 's a shock when writers will stoop this low just to draw cheap laughs by using john hughes ' familiar home alone formula .
i also found it disturbing that the babies in this film have attitude and endless 90 's knowledge , quoting numerous movies and insulting their adult captors .
the effects in baby geniuses ( similar to the talking animals in babe ) are pathetic , the editing is a disaster , and the jokes are never funny .
the only reason viewers may avoid vomiting is the argument that the babies are ` cute ' .
i suppose they are .
i can admit to smiling a few times because the babies were cute .
other instances , though
, i was howling in laughter due to the inane stupidity of the script .
there are supporting characters who have no personality whatsoever ; their entire existence is based on punch lines .
peter macnicol and kim cattrall , as an unwilling couple who have adopted sylvester 's twin , are both miscast .
then again , i do n't suppose any performer could handle the uneven material without looking incredibly stupid .
meanwhile , dom deluise plays a fellow who gets hit in the crotch with a monkey wrench ( hahaha ) .
i would avoid baby geniuses at all costs .
instead of watching this , i would recommended filling your bathtub with cement and going snorkeling .
or perhaps you would consider going diving in shark - infested waters . anything to avoid this painful movie .
the final line in the film , spoken by the bratty sylvester , is ` if they think i 'm doing the sequel for less than $ 20 mill , they 're nuts ' .
sequel ?

"susan granger 's review of "" hearts in atlantis "" ( castle rock / warner bros . )
timing is everything , and the timing just seems right for this poignant psychological drama that combines the coming - of - age nostalgia of "" stand by me "" with the mystical power of "" the green mile .
""
based on stephen king stories adapted by screenwriter william goldman and directed by scott hicks , it 's set in 1960 in harwich , connecticut , where fatherless 11 year - old bobby garfield ( anton yelchin ) lives in a boarding house with his resentful , self - centered mother ( hope davis ) .
he 's devoted to his neighborhood friends ( mika boorem , will rothhaar ) but his pivotal relationship is with a strange , new tenant , ted brautigan ( anthony hopkins ) who opens the world of literature to him after his selfish mother refuses to buy him a birthday gift and hands him , instead , a library card .
knowing he 's longing for a schwinn bike , ted offers to pay him $ 1 a week to read him the local newspaper and keep his eyes peeled for signs of the malevolent , ominous low men who are chasing him to exploit his special powers .
the story structure consists of one long flashback , framed by the present , featuring the adult bobby ( david morse ) , minimizing the supernatural elements while emphasizing the human drama hopkins ' mysterious character is genteel , sensitive and benignly seductive .
the only explanation is that he 's a psychic who is wanted by the fbi to aid in their hunt for communists and even that seems appropriate , given the inexplicable state of the world right now .
the production values and performances are solid , particularly hopkins - arguably the finest , most versatile actor of our era - and the children with whom he forges a firm bond .
on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , "" hearts in atlantis "" is a wistful , enigmatic 8 , evolving with subtle power to an emotionally effective catharsis .",1,"['emotionally effective catharsis', 'wistful , enigmatic', 'performances are solid']"
"some movies i should just skip .
my daughter and i had a really vile time at my favorite martian a few weeks back , and here comes another disney effects - filled live - action flick based on an old tv program .
true , the probgram is only 15 years old this time , and it 's a cartoon .
but it 's a cartoon i liked , and i was understandably reluctant to see what disney had done to it on the big screen .
but my daughter really wanted to go , and how bad could it be ?
turns out i was right , mostly .
inspector gadget , oddly enough , follows almost exactly the same format as my favorite martian , down to the jive - talking side - kick .
at first i thought it was done by the same people , but imdb informs me that ig was directed by david kellogg and written by dana olsen and kerry ehrin , where mfm was directed by donald petrie and written by sherri stoner and deanna oliver .
this odd similarity between the two movies may best be explained by the studio that produced it , where "" formula "" is n't just business
, it 's a way of life .
the producers who obviously micromanaged the two projects should get prominant screen credits .
in some parts you can just hear them saying "" more zany !
i want more zany here -- and -- here .
""
"" let 's have a really painful sexual reference for no reason right here -- make it really painful .
i want the audience squirming in their seats .
""
"" ok , that 's fine , but i want you to add bug guts .
""
"" what does this scene do ?
character depth ?
but where 's the zaniness ?
i do n't see zany here .
if you ca n't make it zany , cut it !
""
the latter is the only explanation i can come up with for the absence of the thoroughly charming michelle trachtenberg for most of the movie .
michelle ( who plays penny , gadget 's niece ) shines in every scene she 's in , but unfortunately
she only gets about nine minutes of screen time .
my guess is that the rest is on the cutting room floor .
dabney coleman 's comedic talents are utterly wasted as chief quimby .
i kept expecting him to say or do something really funny and somehow save the film , but instead , he does the best he can with some really poor lines in a few unexceptional scenes .
he is thoroughly upstaged by cheri oteri as the "" gidget bitch from hell "" town mayor .
oteri 's
overly enthusiastic and continually self - congratulatory speech patterns and mannerisms were so much like portland , oregon 's own manic mayor vera katz that i had to wonder if the studio was n't poking fun at our fair town .
or , maybe all career politicians are like that .
i must say , matthew broderick does not stroll through inspector gadget as he did godzilla .
he appears to have some fun with the film , especially as the evil gadget .
rupert everett is entertaining as the maniacle claw .
joely fisher does fine as the zany scientist and even better as the zany carbon copy of herself .
her performance is one of the few things worth watching in the film .
d .
l . hughley plays the shuckin'-and - jivin ' vehicular side - kick , in a role that firmly sets emancipation back 20 years .
the dialog is . . .
let 's face it ,
it 's pretty bad .
the tag - line after a major set - piece battle is a faux pas that makes no sense in context .
a lot of the lines ( especially hughley 's ) appear to be made up as they go along , by people with little gift for ad - lib .
about three - quarters of the film is a somewhat unnecessary origin story for both gadget and claw .
gadget then spends the latter third of the movie trying to locate claw and having various altercations ( not really "" battles "" ) with the evil gadget .
penny does about a minute and a half of the detective work her character did every week in the cartoon .
let me rage here just for a minute .
michelle trachtenberg was an excellent choice for the penny character .
she 's utterly charming , and has excellent experience ( harriet the spy ) for the part of the pint - size detective .
why she is so underutilized
in this film is a real mystery .
the film loses a star for casting brilliance coupled with scripting ( or editing )
stupidity .
inspector gadget is missing the long , long stretches of potty humor that ( among other things ) made my favorite martian so unbearable , but it 's a very short movie , so perhaps something was cut at the last moment .
probably the best scenes in the film occur during the end credits .
the "" evil sidekick support group "" is especially worth seeing , and has an amazing number of cameo appearances for the few seconds it 's onscreen .
all in all , another bad live action film from the premere studio for bad live action films .
i wonder if disney uses the revenues for it 's generally money - making cartoons to produce these losers
.
but if true , why ?
if they 're trying for another mary poppins , they need to find a team that can produce one , and then give them a chance to do it .",0,"[""it 's pretty bad"", 'makes no sense', 'unnecessary origin story', 'stupidity', 'unfortunately', 'really poor lines', 'made up as they go along', 'she is so underutilized', 'these losers', 'a really painful sexual reference for no reason', 'little gift', 'utterly wasted', 'another bad live action film']"
"a couple of criminals ( mario van peebles and loretta devine ) move into a rich family 's house in hopes of conning them out of their jewels .

""
the faculty , the latest movie by from dusk till dawn director robert rodriguez , certainly proves this in typical hollywood fashion .
there 's not a measureable fraction of original material in this unworthy outing .
drawing elements from both the puppet masters and invasion of the body snatchers , screenwriter kevin williamson ( of scream 2 credit ) gives us a horror tale set in middle america ( ohio ) one eventful fall .
making use of a cast of unusually stock characters , williamson designs an alien invasion that will not be done independence day - style but rather "" through the back door .
"" parasitic aliens take over the faculty of a run - down high school and soon have infested most of the student body , leaving it up to the ensemble of principal characters to win the day .
the lack of gusto is the movie 's major stumbling block .
even though the genre has seen movies that have a lack for quality such as this , they 've been saved by an energetic approach .
this casts more than a shadow of a doubt on williamson 's ability , who enjoyed success with the wes craven - directed scream but could n't pull anything solid in for this outing or i know what you did last summer .
although he designs the faculty with more of a sci - fi bent than his typical slasher picture , it still comes down to the same results : throw the stock characters in a steel cage match and see who comes out alive .
on that level , the main roles are played by virtual unknowns .
only the recognizeable elijah wood ( deep impact ) is at the front ; other than that , the screen veterans are saved for the minor roles of the alien teachers .
perhaps williamson has it in mind to champion these up - and - comers to the fame that their scream and last summer counterparts achieved ; but to do that , they 'd all need to star in their own wb television show about the horrors of puberty a la "" dawson 's creek .
"" needless to say the acting is far from top notch , nor does necessity ask that it should be .

"notting hill 's trailer is awful : a laughless , schmaltzy montage .
the movie was desperately marketed to the anti - phantom menace crowd , the same lovelorn females who ignored the love letter .
and it apparently worked .
perhaps the presence of julia roberts - whose allure beyond those perfect teeth still escapes me - had a lot to do with notting hill 's opening weekend success , but the film 's staying power is based on word of mouth . allow me to spread some more good buzz for notting hill .
grant stars as william thacker , a travel - bookstore owner who works and resides in a tiny english district called notting hill .
into his shop one day wanders famous actress anna scott ( roberts ) .
a common thief , some spilled orange juice , and
some stilted conversation leads to their first , highly impetuous ( or is that improbable ? ) , kiss .
days later , william sneaks into her hotel suite under the guise of a magazine journalist , and so begins a passionate , albeit surreptitious , affair .
( aside : notting hill 's portrayal of press junkets is deadly accurate . )
only anna 's celebrity - or william 's lack thereof - threatens to drive a wedge between them .
richard curtis has tapped into fantasy we all have considered , and for at least its first half - hour the picture 's "" beauty and the beast "" -like scenario is ( romantic ) escapism of the highest order .
as with groundhog day or pleasantville , while watching the high - concept comedy notting hill one constantly imagines him / herself in the lead ; it 's william 's ordinaryness that entices the spoiled and bored anna .
curtis ( who previously penned four weddings and a funeral ) is also smart enough to know that the unlikely couple 's situation is not enough to fuel two hours ' worth of entertainment , so
some of notting hill 's finest moments revolve around william 's eccentric friends and family .
by now , dear reader , you 've probably heard a lot about rhys ifans ' performance as william 's imbecilic welsh flatmate .
yes , he 's a crowd pleaser , a walking sight gag , but his character is not nearly as involving as the wheelchair - bound ( and appropriately named ) bella ( mckee , the anguished waitress of naked ) or max ( tom mcinnerny ) , her lousy chef of a husband .
in the movie 's best sequence , william , anna , and company sit around bloated from max 's latest concoction and hold a contest : the last brownie on the table goes to the diner with the saddest life .
the scene ends only as a british writer would end it .
if anything , fantastic bits like these dull the main plot 's dramatic impact .
roberts and grant , especially , are appealing , but their relationship is convolutedly interrupted too many times ( four weddings ' suffered similar flaws ) , and william and anna ultimately only have one thing in common
: they 're lonely .
( worth noting in roberts ' and grant 's favour : the ubiquitous "" i 'm just a girl , standing across from a boy , asking him to love her "" episode is not nearly so syrupy as it appears in clips , and it features some of the best emoting either actor has ever done . )
notting hill is nonetheless enjoyable
; on the visual side of things , i especially appreciated michell 's playful changing - of - the - seasons number . if only ( and this is a surprisinly minor gripe ) he had lopped off the egregious epilogue ; for a story that thrives on what we bring to it , the filmmakers work too hard to tidy things up , leaving our imaginations in the lurch .",1,"[""he 's a crowd pleaser , a walking sight gag"", 'are appealing', ""some of notting hill 's finest moments"", 'allow me to spread some more good buzz', 'is nonetheless enjoyable', 'it features some of the best emoting either actor has ever done']"
"modern audiences are more likely to be familiar with les misirables from the pop - broadway musical rather than victor hugo 's original tome .
adapted several times for the cinema , this latest effort
does a superb job of translating the characters , story , and heart of the novel to the screen .
liam neeson stars as jean valjean .
as a young man , valjean stole some bread to satisfy his hunger . . .
and he was sentenced to 19 years of hard labor for his crimes .
prison hardened him , and on his release he seems doomed to a life of crime and squalor .
however , an unexpected act of compassion changes his outlook on life , and he vows to become a better man .
however , he runs up against one man who does n't believe in reform .
inspector javert ( geoffrey rush ) is an obsessive law abider .
he has no tolerance for anyone who breaks the rules , even with benign intentions .
he once served as a guard at the labor camp where valjean served , and after valjean breaks his parole , javert devotes himself to bringing him to justice .
two women also get caught up in the struggle .
fantine ( uma thurman ) is an unwed mother suffocating in an unforgiving society .
her daughter , cosette ( mimi newman , and later , claire danes ) , is her life , yet she can not afford to raise her .
instead , cosette is sent to live with a cruel foster family which extorts money from fantine , and forces cosette into a life little better than a slave .
director bille august manages to create a faithful adaptation of victor hugo 's novel , which , though omitting some of the political undertones , remains true to the overall story and tone of the book .
hopefully you wo n't , as some clueless members of the audience did , wonder where all the songs went .
the movie manages to be completely engrossing without the andrew lloyd webber flourishes .
the experience is bolstered by strong performances throughout , though neeson and rush deservedly take center stage with their core roles .
neeson
in particular deserves kudos for his portrayal of a man trying to do good , but continually haunted by his past .
the supporting cast is also extraordinary .
the only actor who dims in comparison is hans matheson , playing the revolutionary , marius .
the film slightly loses its luster during his brief love affair , but it is transitory , and truly only distracting when contrasted with the rest of the film .
the novel les misirables is , by any account , an epic , both in its scope and in its length .
while it would be nearly impossible to cram everything from its pages into a two hour movie ,
this latest attempt does an admirable job at the translation .
it , too , is an epic . . .

"deep rising is one of "" those "" movies .
the kind of movie which serves no purpose except to entertain us .
it does not ask us to think about important questions like life on other planets or the possibility that there is no god . . .
screw that , it says boldly , let 's see some computer generated monsters rip into , decapitate and generally cause irreparable booboos to a bunch of little known actors .
heh !
them wacky monsters , got ta love 'em .
of course , since we can rent about a thousand b movies with the same kind of story , hollywood must give that little extra "" oumph "" to get people in theaters .
that is where deep rising fails , which is a good thing
.
confused ? let me explain : despite all them flashy effects and big explosions , deep rising is still , at heart , a good ' ol b movie .
luckily , it 's a very good b movie .
the worst cliches in movie history are a b movie 's bread and butter .
therefore , things that would destroy a serious movie actually help us have a good time while watching a movie of lower calibre .
of course we know there 's a big slimy creature behind that door , that one person will wander off to be picked off by said monster and we always know which persons or person will make it out alive .
we just do n't know when or how horrible it will be .
i went to see deep rising with my expections low and my tolerance for bad dialogue high .
imagine my surprise when i discover that deep rising is actually , well ,
pretty darn funny at times .
a funny b movie ?
well , that 's new .
these flicks are not supposed to make us laugh .
( except for a few unintended laughs once a while . ) and before you know it , treat williams , wes studi and famke jansen appear on the big screen .
hey !
i know them guys ( and gal ) from a couple of other movies .
cool .
familiar faces .
so far so good .
our man treat is the hero , he 'll live .
wes is a staple of b movies , he is the token victim .
we know he 'll buy the farm
but he will take a few creeps with him on the way out .
famke is the babe , 'nuff said .
there is also a guy with glasses ( the guy with glasses always dies ) a black person ( b movie buffs know that the black guy always dies , never fails ) and a very funny , nerdy guy .
( ah ! comic relief .
how can we possibly explain having to kill him . . .
let him live . )
after the first fifteen minutes i felt right at home .
i know who to root for and who i need to boo too and a gum to chew .
( please kill me . )
suffice it to say that for the next hour and a half i jumped out of my seat a few times , went "" ewwww "" about a dozen times and nearly had an orgasm over all the explosions and firepower our heroes were packing .

"for a film touted as exploring relationships and black sexuality , trois is surprisingly tame .
despite it 's lurid subject matter and it 's passing nod to fatal attraction ,
it moves along with flat , uninspired dialogue as it sets up a surprising climax that tries mightily to overthrow the considerable dead weight of the rest of the film .
freshly moved to atlanta , jermaine ( dourdan ) and his wife , jasmine ( moore ) , have the trappings of a perfect life .
they have a beautiful house in suburbia .
jermaine is a lawyer on the fast track at his firm .
jasmine is his supportive wife , who is finishing up her college degree .
in an opening montage via a home video of the pair , we see the unremarkable story of their marriage and early marital triumphs .
this is a couple that has it all .
into this eden slithers the lure of lust .
despite his outward appearance , jermaine reveals himself as selfish and covetous of his wife more as a possession than a person .
a glimmer of his true nature peeks out during an early sex scene with his wife as he goes about his business , oblivious to jasmine 's concerns .
we also find that he has been relentlessly asking jasmine to participate in a menage- a - trois , much to jasmine 's dismay .
as jermaine puts it , "" do n't you want to be sexually free ?
""
jermaine shares his desire with co - worker terrence ( smith ) , who obligingly sets jermaine up with a woman who might be interested in just such an encounter .
the woman , jade ( palmer ) is a direct counterpoint to jasmine .
jade , at one point was a college student , too .
unlike jasmine , she found herself pregnant , dropped out of school and now struggles to make ends meet .
to further reinforce their differences , it 's revealed that jade is involved in a custody battle over her son .
inevitably , through liquor and a touch of duplicity on jermaine 's part , the forbidden act is consummated .
the aftermath of the encounter sidesteps into fatal attraction territory as acts of violence are perpetrated upon jermaine 's property with the hint that the violence may escalate .
by this point , trois shows itself to be a soap opera without the requisite melodrama : a fatal attraction without the social significance .
the exploration of relationships is strictly superficial and stereotypical .
jermaine comes off as insincere , sexually driven and selfish .
jasmine is bland and subservient .
jade comes off a bit sympathetically , but that is negated by her moral bankruptcy .
yet another tale of a sexually aggressive "" dog "" of a man who imposes his will upon his accommodating , innocent mate .
the last 10 minutes will undoubtly throw you a curve , but by this point , will you even care ?
if the rest of the movie was as dynamic as the ending , perhaps there could have been some freshness to it .
as it stands , trois is pretty standard fare .",0,"['the exploration of relationships is strictly superficial and stereotypical', 'it moves along with flat , uninspired dialogue', 'by this point , will you even care ?', 'shows itself to be a soap opera without the requisite melodrama', 'surprisingly tame', 'bland and subservient', 'pretty standard fare']"
"in october of 1997 , audiences were dazzled by the horror surprise hit i know what you did last summer .
the film went on to gross over 70 million dollars in the u . s . , and even developed a cult following , much like the previous year 's 100 million dollar grossing scream .
when the trailer hit theaters in september attached to urban legend , it looked like a wonderful follow - up .
did it live up to the first film ?
the answer is no .
jennifer love hewitt returns as julie james , a survivor of the serial killer that attempted to kill her and her friends a year before .
she has been so upset since the incident .
nightmares haunt her all over the place , but she has to move on .
she know attends college , and is best friends with a funny , outgoing girl named karla ( brandy ) , who is trying to hook julie up with will benson , played by newcomer matthew settle .
karla 's boyfriend is tyrell , the funny , outgoing type , who is played by soul food 's mekhi phifer .
freddie prinze jr . also returns as ray , julie 's boyfriend from a year ago .
one morning , julie and karla are called up by a local radio station who are offering four tickets to the bahamas if they can correctly identify the capital of brazil .
of course , they answer it correctly , and they are off to the bahamas .
julie wants ray to come , but he declines the offer , so karla secretly invites will instead to help boost her plan of hooking him up with julie .
after they arrive at their hotel , it is just them and the staff on the island .
it starts off as the weekend of their dreams .
something just had to come to mess up the one care - free weekend of julie 's life though .
ben willis ( muse watson ) is back , and he is n't letting anyone survive this time .
will ray come to the rescue before he can kill them off one by one ?
jennifer love hewitt and brandy turn in respectable performances .
brandy in particular was impressive , considering this is her first feature film .
you could see that the characters were horrified , and they would do anything possible to survive .
matthew settle and freddie prinze jr . are a completely different story .
let 's start with settle .
matthew is completely fake in this film .
you could not believe a word coming out of his mouth .
you could tell he was acting , and its reasons like him that this one is n't as good as the first one .
he does do a good job towards the end , but that does n't clear up the scars he already left on the film .
freddie prinze jr .
is almost as bad as matthew settle was .
he is almost completely unbelievable , and the majority of his lines are completely meaningless and out of place .
we do n't see him as much as settle , otherwise he could have done just as much damage as settle did .
mekhi phifer is alright as tyrell , but yet again the dialogue is out of place .
the plot of i still know turns out to be a pretty good one
at the end of the movie .
i like where the filmmakers went with this second installment , but maybe if it occurred in the same town as the first one , it would have been a bit better .
the cinematography and setting of their island are simply wonderful .
there are a lot of very nice shots around their hotel .
the sound is pretty good , but still not as creepy as the first film 's .
jennifer love hewitt 's song , "" how do i deal "" is also played for about thirty seconds .
i still know what you did last summer is nothing compared to the first film .
the first film was very suspenseful , and it contained some very memorable scenes .
the last fifteen minutes of i still know what you did last summer really picked up , and almost reached the same level as the first film .
before this part in the film , there are many unnecessary deaths and fake scares .
that is okay though , because the film is still very much fun
and there are a few suspenseful scenes .
i think the reason this film was n't as scary as the original was because in the first one , the killer terrorized the people involved in the incident .
he made them suffer for what they did .
in the second film , ben willis just kills anyone he feels like .
he does n't stick with ray and julie , who were the ones he is actually after .
he had to go after karla , will , and tyrell .
if the characters he stalked were in some relation to the incident that went on when he was ran over by julie , ray , helen , and barry , it could have been much better , and it would have made a lot more sense .
the bottom line- not a disappointment , but
a third in the series would be out of hand .",1,"['turns out to be a pretty good one', 'the film is still very much fun', 'are simply wonderful', 'turn in respectable performances']"
"capsule : this is a harrowing look at a rarely dramatized chapter of wwii , life in a japanese prison camp .
to end all wars is a moving film about the struggle of prisoners to retain their humanity and their dignity .
the somewhat religious interpretation may not be to everyone 's taste .
,
+3 ( -4 to +4 ) more than any other people the japanese seem capable of acting with one goal and not letting any other consideration get in their way .
this may be a holdover from the code of bushido when loyalty to ones master was the only law .
during world war ii , of course , the one goal was winning the war .
this led them to do some very inhuman things in pursuit of that goal .
when the japanese had captured prisoners , they were very much treated in whatever way would be optimum for achieving the one goal .
minimum resources were to be spent in maintaining prisoners in keeping with maximal positive output .
while the germans , not known for their kindness in those days , had a 6 % mortality rate among captured prisoners of war , the mortality rate of japanese prisoners of war was 27 % .
the best thing for the war effort was working prisoners nearly to death on the thailand to burma railroad .
that railroad was needed if japan was to attack india as it planned to do .
the best thing for the effort was not to waste much food on the prisoners so short and amazingly wretched food was the order of the day .
and just being in the jungle without proper medical aid took its toll .
in the public mind japan has never been held as accountable for war atrocities as was germany .
filmmakers have been reticent to tell the story , perhaps for fear of offending the japanese .
there are comparatively few films about the japanese pow camps .
certainly there was david lean 's the bridge on the river kwai .
there were some low - budget british exploitation films and that was about it .
then there were tv series "" a town like alice "" and "" tenko .
""
lest the experience be forgotten we have a new film to end all wars directed by david cunningham and written by brian godawa .
it is based on the account of ernest gordan who survived the horror of that world war ii prison camp and went on to become for 26 years the dean of the chapel at princeton university .
the film while realistic shows the conditions in the camp as being considerably more brutal and sadistic than bridge on the river kwai portrayed them .
the story opens with six or so soldiers being marched into the prison camp only to be immediately placed in front of a firing squad .
it turns out to be a grim joke , one of many that the sadistic japanese play to amuse themselves .
beating and torture are commonplace events .
men already imprisoned tell the new arrivals to enjoy the last of their health ; it will not last long with parasites and disease almost inevitable .
however , unlike as in kwai , the prisoners want to avoid going to the hospital , called by the prisoners the death house .
so goes a war within a war with the prisoners trying to maintain their humanity and with the japanese trying to make them interchangeable and highly expendable cogs in a rail - laying machine .
this is more than just a battle of who will win the war but a battle of ideologies .
the japanese believe that the individual is nothing , that conformity to group 's norms is all that gives a life meaning .
conformity is purpose .
before the film is over there will be some surprising revelations about the character of the prisoners and the character of those running the camp .
if this story showed nothing but sadism from the japanese it would be one kind of story .
if the british ( with one american , by the way ) and the japanese learned to respect each other it would be another kind of story .
it is neither .
it is a stirring and believable account of camp life .
the color has been distorted in the film to give a washed out yellow .
this serves a double purpose for cunningham .
it gives an effect of technicolor film that has been left in heat .
it also creates a distancing effect .
the only touch that seems a little out of place is the use of gaelic music .
this is a powerful and philosophical view of the prison camp experience .
i rate it a 9 on the 0 to 10 scale and a +3 on the -4 to +4 scale .",1,"['a powerful and philosophical view', 'a stirring and believable account']"
"by - the - numbers : a film which introduces characters , situations , dilemmas and developments that we 've seen before in a parade of other films .
a film which can easily be guessed out by the end of frame number one .
a film which is packed to the cap with predictability , leading to very little tension , excitement , suspense or interest on the part of its paying audience .
in short , a clich ?
-ridden formula film .
welcome to my review of the general 's daughter .
plot :
an undercover army detective and a rape counselor find themselves locked inside an investigation into some bigwig general daughter 's rape , torture and murder .
they must delve through all of the unspoken army rules and the hush - hushes , to figure out the conspiracy behind the shocking murder .
critique : by the numbers
( see above ) .
this film is just there .
it sits there on the big screen for a couple of hours , floats around , goes away , hopefully never to be heard from again .
it is so predictable that even a blind man could see its plot points coming a mile away .
it 's as suspenseful as a leaf dropping from a tree .
it 's as action - packed as a canadian curling tournament
.
get the picture ?
i sure did . . .
it 's too bad that it took my friend
and i less than two minutes to figure out the entire plot , and to break down each scene before it was even completed .
easy as pie .
it 's unfortunate because james woods and john travolta actually have one extremely enjoyable scene together near the beginning of the film , but alas , t'was not to be
( that scene alone scored two of my four points allotted . )
woods chews it up in the few scenes that he 's in , travolta passes the test , cromwell plays , well , cromwell , and stowe is window dressing with a smile ( mia since 12 monkeys ( 8/10 )
it seems ) .
and this predictability is n't reserved only to those who have seen films like courage under fire or a few good men , it runs deep inside every one of us who knows to suspect someone as soon as they see their obvious guilty mug on the big screen .
it 's like riding a bike .
other scenarios which sponge out any tension , suspense or interest from this film include every single character eventually "" breaking down "" to the investigators without much reason given , a ridiculously placed background relationship between two of the lead characters , as much action as my grandparents bedroom nightly , and a directorial style that can only reward director simon west with a solid nomination for the "" best poor man 's michael bay doing his best poor man 's impression of tony scott
"" ( add two scenes with sunlight shining through some half - open shades for grit and integrity , and an all - out rainfall for the finale for further chaos , and you 're a great director . yawn .
yeah ,

i mean , simon . )

next subject ,
please . see it on video if you wanna fall asleep after seeing a much better movie like an officer and a gentleman ( 8 . 5/10 ) .
otherwise , save yourself the trouble and go take a crap instead .
you 'll feel much better afterwards .
trust me .
little known facts about this film and its stars : ironically , john travolta turned down the lead role in an officer and a gentleman , which eventually went to little dickie gere .
ironically on james woods ' part , he completed one of his earliest acting roles on tv 's "" welcome back , kotter "" , starring none other than john travolta .
actor james woods recently confirmed reports of his "" big dick "" on howard stern 's radio program .
unlike rocker tommy lee , woods is also alleged to have an iq of 180 .
he apparently scored a perfect 800 on his verbal sats and a 779 on the math section .
what a man !
john travolta is married to actress kelly preston , and they have a son named jett
( travolta loves them planes ! ) .
word on the street is that the kid was apparently conceived during a weekend at demi moore and bruce willis ' home .
director simon west 's first film was the jerry bruckheimer produced con air ( 6 . 5/10 ) .
before that , he directed tv commercials including the budweiser ad with the dancing ants .
yippee !
veteran director john frankenheimer ( ronin ( 7 . 5/10 ) , the manchurian candidate ) portrays the character of general sonnenberg in this film .
the imdb reports that when senator robert kennedy was shot at the ambassador hotel in los angeles on june 5 , 1968 , it was his good friend john frankenheimer who had personally driven him there that day .
clarence williams iii , who plays colonel fowler in this film , is known to some from his role as "" linc "" in the original "" mod squad "" tv series .

"capsule : this is a 1950s or 1960s style heist film , set in the present .
robert deniro stars as a risk - adverse safecracker who wants to retire form crime but takes one last job at the request of a personal friend ( played by marlon brando ) .
edward norton plays a hotshot young sharpster who is also in on the crime .
the plot is mostly straightforward suspense with little nonsense .
,
+2 ( -4 to +4 ) i am sure i must have seen almost the identical plot before .
this is a heist film made for an adult audience who probably wanted a crime film like they had seen in theaters when they were teens .
there are no superhuman acrobats taking nosedives off of buildings like in entrapment .
there is no rock score .
there are no ballet- like martial arts .
this is just a basic heist film with a decent and distinctly credible and un - flashy script .
nick ( played by robert deniro ) is a safecracker who has managed to be successful by never taking risks .
if a job is not a safe bet ( pun intended ) , he backs out .
sometimes even the safe bets turn out not to be so safe .
when one job very nearly goes wrong nick is unnerved enough to decide that it is nature telling him that it is time to get out of the game .
he returns to his home in montreal where he owns a jazz club , and decides to manage it full time .
he proposes to his girl friend diane ( angela bassett ) .
she has one condition .
he must stay retired from crime .
but before the deal can be cemented , max , a montreal kingpin and personal friend , has one last supposedly easy job for nick .
nick wants no part particularly because the heist will be right in his hometown of montreal .
more and more details seem to complicate the job .
nick 's partner in the crime is to be a smart , but uncontrollable young crook , jack ( edward norton ) .
jack treats a locked front door like a welcome mat , even at his associates ' homes .
the young crook is a know - it - all who seems good at everything he does but at avoiding rubbing people the wrong way .
together they plan to steal a priceless historic artifact from the montreal customs house .
the script by kario salem , lem dobbs , and scott marshall smith works like an episode of the old "" mission impossible "" television series .
we see pieces of the heist being put together , last minute changes , and things that go wrong , much like a good episode of "" mission impossible .
""
this team might not be bad choices to write scripts for the tom cruise "" mission impossible "" films .
the complications are , however no more and no fewer than are needed to make the story believable .
the telling is cold and noirish , which is just what it is supposed to be .
director frank oz , the voices of yoda and miss
piggy proves surprisingly good at directing a serious crime film .
the score has a more than adequate cast with little flashy or scene - stealing acting .
edward norton probably has the flashiest role and even that is low - key by today 's standards .
he plays what is nearly a double role .
jack pretends to be a brain damage victim to be hired for a job in the customs house .
one nice ( ?
) character i have not mentioned is stephen ( jamie harrold ) .
stephen is a master hacker who lives in his mother 's basement in a house with a lot of screaming in both directions .
he seems like the last person the risk adverse nick would want to depend upon .
the film itself remains low - key up until the time of the climactic heist .
then the pace really picks up .
before that the plot even stops twice for jazz interludes .
though oz never lets the music steal time from the story the way woody allen does in sweet and lowdown .
on the subject of music , the score of the score is by howard shore .
it adds tension to the suspense scenes , but never seems to have much of a melody .
angela bassett is the one misused celebrity in a totally minor role that should have been played by a less famous actress who needed a break .
she has nothing to do in the film but demand that nick give up crime and to look like an attractive reward if he does .
speaking of being attractive the score seems to be attracting an older audience who learned to appreciate much the same sort of film in the 1950s and 1960s .
it does the job .
i rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a +2 on the -4 to +4 scale .",1,"['a decent and distinctly credible and un - flashy script', 'a more than adequate cast with little flashy or scene - stealing acting', 'it does the job']"
"i want to correct what i wrote last year in my retrospective of david lean 's war picture .
i still think that "" the bridge on the river kwai "" does n't deserve being the number 13 in the american film institute 's list of the 100 greatest american movies .
and i think that "" 12 angry men "" , "" witness for the prosecution "" and "" paths of glory "" would have been better choices for the oscar for the best picture of 1957 .
but i ca n't deny the importance of "" the bridge on the river kwai "" - cinematically and in its contents .
the film is set in burma in 1943 .
a batallion of british soldiers in japanese war captivity is forced by the japanese to build a strategically momentous railway bridge over the river kwai .
but the british commanding officer , colonel nicholson ( alec guinness ) , insists - corresponding to the geneva conventions - that his officers need n't work as simple workmen .
struggling toughly , col .
nicholson forces the japanese commandant , col .
saito ( sessue hayakawa ) , to give way in this respect .
afterwards col .
nicholson assiduously commits himself for the building of the bridge .
he considers it an opportunity to raise his men 's morale , and he wants to prove superior british capabilities to the japanese .
but the british high command sends a few soldiers who shall destroy the bridge , among them the american shears ( william holden ) - an escapee from the japanese prison camp - and the british major warden ( jack hawkins ) . . .
a flaw of the picture is the clich ?
d characterization of the japanese people .
they are presented as if they were intellectually inferior to the british - as if the japanese were incapable of building a bridge .
and the film does n't consistently question the military spirit as kubrick does in "" paths of glory "" .
lean seems rather fascinated by the military hierarchies .
this is also perceptible in the conversations between col . nicholson and col .
saito .
in this regard it is symptomatic that shears , who doubts the military logic , is presented as a somehow unpleasant person .
the audience is supposed to applaud
col .
nicholson 's perseverance concerning the question if his officers shall work on the bridge or not .
the spectators are supposed to neglect the risks col .
nicholson takes for his men .
( the plot by - passes these risks . )
that means , the picture is n't perfect .
but it has a lot of virtues as well .
""
the bridge on the river kwai "" shows the "" madness "" of war and what it can produce in people 's minds .
it shows how colonel nicholson becomes possessed by the idea of being a hero and that others ( like shears ) get cynics .
and lean 's film is an interesting study of characters with clashing interests .
these points and the sometimes ironic dialogue make this film an anti - war film ( despite inconsistencies in the treatment of this theme ) .
david lean 's direction is really effective and atmospherically perfect .
his film is highly suspenseful , especially in its dramatic ( if not wholly plausible ) showdown .
the film is also well - photographed and has an apt score .
alec guinness does a magnificent job of bringing col . nicholson to life and making him such an interesting character .
the other actors deliver fine performances as well .
i like this extraordinary film despite its weaknesses .

against his better judgment , max agrees .
of course ricky , a motormouth who inserts both feet everytime he speaks , nearly screws up everything . while bobby tries to stay calm and professional , ricky begins swaggering and throwing money around as if he was john gotti or tony soprano .

bobby is button - downed , tightly - wound , always waiting for the next shoe -courtesy of ricky - to drop .

"this is the worst movie i 've viewed so far in 98 .
the avengers = silly = man dressed in a bowler hat + woman wearing tight leathers
> evil scientists dressed in teddy bear suits + greater evil , sir august de wynter wearing kilt .
the question is what could have gone wrong with a potentially great idea with big name cast ?
the same question was probably asked of last year 's stinker batman and robin .
i feel the production got a little too smug ,
the script a little to smart and direction was somehow lost in the chaos of random events that collided together to form a movie .
my greatest criticism rests on the fact that there was no chemistry between emma peel and john steed ( thurman and fiennes ) ?
something that was a vital element of the 60 's tv serial of the same name .
the dialogue goes on and on about tea and other finer british perks , but does not allow much room for character development and interaction , except to perhaps grate on the viewer 's nerves .
one wonders why the dynamic pair bother kissing in the end except for pure english formality .
connery as sir august , does not fair better than thurman or fiennes .
his dialogue is as erratic as stormy weather , mostly embarrassing and poor quality .
if there is a movie you would prefer never to see , i believe the avengers would be a good choice .
for one thing , you will not have to witness a product that is far inferior to the three high profile names that is associated with the title .

so poorly produced could have been released , but i put it down to one of those freak happenings in nature , like lightning you ca n't see it coming until it hits you .",0,"['there was no chemistry', 'got a little too smug', 'his dialogue is as erratic as stormy weather , mostly embarrassing and poor quality', ""grate on the viewer 's nerves"", 'somehow lost in the chaos of random events', 'far inferior', 'so poorly produced', ""the worst movie i 've viewed so far in 98""]"
"from a major league baseball radio broadcast , featuring play - by- play man harry canary and color man whitey hashbrown , with special guest commentator james berardinelli .
hc : as we go to the top of the 8th , we 're joined in the booth by film critic james berardinelli , who 's here fresh from seeing the new baseball movie , major league : back to the minors , the third in the popular saga taking a lighter look at the majors .
nice to see you ,
jim . as a big baseball fan and a movie reviewer
, can you give us the scoop on the new flick ?
jb :
my opinion : the producers should have stopped while they were ahead , and that was nine years ago .
one entry was definitely enough , and i 'm surprised there was a third after the anemic showing and low quality of major league 2 . this latest installment has all the earmarks of something that should have been released direct - to - video .
it 's worse than a mediocre made - for - tv feature .
i should also mention that this movie likely wo n't play all that well in cleveland .
now that the real indians are perennial contenders , they have been replaced by the minnesota twins as the cinematic sadsacks .
actually , most of the action involves the twins ' aaa minor league club , the buzz , rather than the actual major league franchise .
hc : sorry to interrupt , jim , but we still have to do play - by - play for the game on the field .
leading off this inning is john warren .
he steps into the batter 's box and takes kent 's pitch low for ball one .
wh :
so , the story 's strictly minor league , right ?
what 's it about ?
jb :
scott bakula , the guy from quantum leap , plays career minor league pitcher gus cantrell .
when twins owner roger dorn , once again portrayed by corbin bernsen , needs a new manager for his aaa team , he offers the job to gus , who is now faced with two daunting tasks : turn the team around and groom hot prospect
downtown anderson ( played by walt goggins ) for a promotion to "" the show .
"" with the help of former major leaguers pedro cerrano ( dennis haysbert ) , rube baker ( eric bruskotter ) , and isuro tanaka ( takaaki ishibashi ) , gus gets the buzz on the right track .
in fact , he is so successful that he earns the enmity of the jealous manager of the big - league club , leonard huff ( played with over - the - top relish by ted mcginley ) .
soon , dorn has arranged an exhibition game that pits gus ' overachieving group against huff 's overpaid , last - place bunch .
wh : can we guess who wins ?
jb : the results have all the suspense of watching the videotape of a game when you 've already seen the box score .
on top of that , none of the mock - ups are presented with much flair .
they 're not just boring ; they 're lackluster .
but the major league movies have never been about drama or tension
; they 've been about using baseball situations to generate laughs .
hc : warren fouls off a fastball .
1 and 1 .
wh : are there lots of yuks in this one ?
jb : not one , from start to finish .
i enjoyed the first major league because it was reasonably fresh and funny .
okay , a lot of the jokes were sophomoric , but they made me laugh .
the two sequels have n't just been stale , but their humor quotient has been abysmally low .
even bob uecker 's once - sharp one - liners have turned lame , and they 're the closest the film comes to being even vaguely amusing .
hc : here 's the 1 - 1 pitch .
looooooong drive ? fair or foul ?
foul ball !
the count goes to 1 and 2 .
wh : does the film at least get the baseball details correct ?
jb :
yes .
there are n't any glaring errors
like there were in one of the best - ever baseball movies , the natural .
but i 'd gladly trade a technically accurate film for one with a good story , believable characters , or even a little genuine humor .
heck , the naked gun is a better baseball comedy than major league : back to the minors .
wh : it 's nice to see old friends one more time , is n't it ?
like cerrano , tanaka , and dorn .
jb : depends on whether you really care that anyone is back .
there are n't any real characters here ?
just an assortment of cliched oddballs .
yeah ,
the voodoo hitter , the catcher who ca n't throw back to the pitcher , the japanese player , and the conceited player - turned - owner have all returned , but who really cares ?
they have no depth .
notable absences include tom berenger 's veteran and charlie sheen 's "" wild thing .
""
we do n't really miss them , though .
hc : breaking ball , low and outside .
2 and 2 .
wh
: so you 're saying that we should give this one a miss ?
jb
: that 's right .
to use baseball terminology , it 's a three - pitch strikeout .
if you 're looking for a good movie that involves baseball , try popping the natural , field of dreams , bull durham , or even the first major league into the vcr .
actually , this is an oddly - timed release , since baseball fans are likely to be spending more time in parks than in theaters .
even the minor league seasons are already underway .
do n't bother with major league : back to the minors .
it 's a wretched time- waster .
wh :
thanks for the advice .
jb
: you 're welcome .
hc : and here 's the 2 - 2 pitch .
fouled back , right into this booth .
hey , jim , heads up !
oops .
somebody better get him some ice for that .
he may be good at deflecting bad baseball movies , but he needs to learn not to duck into foul balls .
odd how warren seemed to aim that ball right at him , almost as if he has a grudge to settle .
anyway , back to the action on the field ?",0,"['have turned lame', ""they 're not just boring ; they 're lackluster"", 'just an assortment of cliched oddballs', ""has all the earmarks of something that should have been released direct - to - video . it 's worse than a mediocre made - for - tv feature"", ""it 's a wretched time- waster"", ""have n't just been stale , but their humor quotient has been abysmally low"", 'but who really cares ? they have no depth']"
"' contact ' shows why jodie foster is one of our best actresses .
see contact with your family .
it is a movie for all ages .
--a review by stuart cracraft contact starring : jodie foster , matthew mcconaughey , john hurt director : robert zemeckis star after a predictable mit phillip morrison powers - of-10 zoom - out start ( which can be surprising to those not familiar with prof .
morrison 's work ) , contact picks up steam , gradually , building , by - the - end , an irresistable juggernaut and a very good movie that does not as is so often the case fall out - of - balance in terms of too much pandering to the technological "" geek "" side .
by the end , the audience is left with what good science fiction is supposed to do : evoke a sense of wonder about the universe and evoke questions in your mind about what 's out there .
this movie does not let technology overshadow characterization and in this sense it is unusual amongst high - tech movies .
however , except for jodie foster ( elie arroway ) and john hurt ( s .
r .
hadden ) , who are both actors of exceptional caliber , the supporting cast are not especially impressive .
hurt certainly has had better roles ( stephen ward in scandal ) .
this one , as the multi - billionare hadden , does not do his acting skills justice .
this is clearly a foster movie by one of the great hollywood lights of our generation .
foster 's radiance has never been more strong
than in the scene where she finally meets the vegans on their terms .
early scenes take a long , long time to build up to this .
the movie 's pacing is very good and subtle .
the panoramas of the radio dishes at arecibo and ceti in new mexico and puerto rico are beautiful .
the politics of foster 's character attempting to obtain funding for research at these places are trite and predictable however .
one of the most entertaining , but very short scenes , is when foster is confronted by rob lowe , during a cabinet - level presidential meeting to discuss the alien invitation .
there were real sparks in this scene between foster and lowe
and it would behoove them to consider other vehicles in which this dynamism could be explored .
it is the only scene in the movie in which there were tremendous dynamics between two characters .
everything else was very one - sided ( e . g . foster ) .
lowe can stand up to foster and it showed in that scene at the cabinet table .
the core scene of the movie is set on a surrealistic beach on a far - away world in the starsystem of vega .
it feels a lot like science fiction writer john varley 's scenes in his book steel beach , where the female protagonists encounters an immensely superior intelligence , in one case a computer manufactured by mankind itself , and in foster 's case , an illusion drawn from her memory .
in another sense , this immensely moving scene evokes gene roddenberry 's star trek pilot the cage ,
later the menagerie , when jeffrey hunter and susan oliver have their memories manipulated to create new worlds in which they live and encounter aliens .
the concept is not new , by any sense , in the world of science fiction .
but the beach scene , which is the centerpiece of the film , as is the whole film , is driven by foster .
freed from her needs to direct by director zemecki , foster is able to let it all hang out in the characterization and the lead she provides to her supporting cast
.
as the movie gains speed , foster 's acting intensifies and the audience really does experience it with her .
it is certainly oscar - caliber acting , unquestionably .
the supporting cast does well and zemeckis throws in some humor with some president clinton cameos , cleverly manipulated , george stephanopolus - style , to seem very forrest gump .
in fact , zemeckis et .
al . got in trouble for the usage of some of the footage seen in the movie , vis a vis clinton .
but the audience i attended this movie with
just had some good chuckles at clinton 's walk - ons .
the much - discussed tension between science and religion in this movie is not particularly insightful to those who have already gone through this course though it is helpful to those in the audience who have not .
also , the near - final scene , in a senate judiciary hearing room is disappointing .
contact is a fitting memorial to the memory of carl sagan , science popularizer , and sometime pedantic gadfly of the halls of academe .
perhaps now , sagan can be said to be with his dragons of eden .",1,"['pacing is very good and subtle', 'freed from her needs to direct by director zemecki , foster is able to let it all hang out in the characterization and the lead she provides to her supporting cast', 'picks up steam , gradually , building , by - the - end , an irresistable juggernaut and a very good movie that does not as is so often the case fall out - of - balance', 'there were tremendous dynamics', ""one of the great hollywood lights of our generation . foster 's radiance has never been more strong"", ""good science fiction is supposed to do : evoke a sense of wonder about the universe and evoke questions in your mind about what 's out there"", 'acting intensifies and the audience really does experience it with her . it is certainly oscar - caliber acting , unquestionably . the supporting cast does well and zemeckis throws in some humor', 'a fitting memorial to the memory', 'are beautiful', 'one of our best actresses . see contact with your family . it is a movie for all ages', 'one of the most entertaining', 'just had some good chuckles']"
"bad movies described as "" a swift descent into sinful pleasure , decay , and debauchery "" are hard to watch .
bad 2000 's movies that resemble bad 1980s films are even harder to watch .
shadow hours falls into the latter category , a mish - mashed train wreck of b - movie actors ( including michael dorn , aka star trek 's worf ) , an uninteresting plot , vain attempts
at capitalizing on the "" underground "" scenes of seedy los angeles , and really , really bad directing and horrendous music video - esque ballistic editing that was taught to me in film school right before i decided to drop out .
the film revolves around the life of michael holloway ( balthazar getty ) who is trying to restart his life with his one - dimensional wife chloe ( rebecca gayheart ) after a nasty bout of drug and alcohol addictions .
michael takes a job of working the graveyard shift at the local gas station and is bombarded by the ugliness and weirdness of the nightlife of l . a .
one night , he meets a strange gent named stuart ( mr .
buckaroo banzai , peter weller ) .
he drives a porsche , smokes french cigarettes , and drones on about life , eventually coaxing mike into exploring the "" underbelly "" of l . a . together , a tour of punk bars , s&m clubs , and bare - knuckle fights .
the film then throws in a murder mystery with a cop played peter greene , acting like he wants to get the chance at a reprisal of his role in the mask 2 .
the film then simply dissolves into a cheap rip - off of dante 's inferno mixed with an old stephen

"of all the films i 've come to see this year ( 1997 ) , i think only chasing amy had as many "" laugh - out - loud "" moments
.
i 'm not saying that i was hysterically rolling on the floor while watching waiting for guffman , but my mouth burst open with at least a delighted guffaw at least every couple of minutes .
and i think i 'm the kind of person that laughs least at movies , even when i find them funny .
usually all you can get out of me is a warm smile , so to get me laughing out loud , and so frequently , is a really good sign .
waiting for guffman is the story of blaine , missouri , a town celebrating
it 's 150th anniversary , and the musical that is being put on for the big event .
the play is being directed by corky st .
clair ( christopher guest , who also wrote and directed this "" mockumentary "" as well as co - writing several original musical numbers ) , the effeminate broadway hopeful determined to make this production a smashing success .
teaming up with st .
clair are a handful of blaine residents : allan pearl ( eugene levy ) , a jewish dentist who spent his youth not as the class clown , but sitting right next to him and studying him , ron and sheila albertson ( fred willard and catherine o'hara respectively ) , a married couple setting their sights on hollywood , libby mae brown ( parker posey ) , the dense but fun queen of the dairy queen , and a few others .
everybody in this movie is brilliant , absolutely so , but levy particularly stands out .
these characters are portrayed with such saddening realism that you ca n't help but love them , as pathetic as they really are .
although levy stands out , guest , willard , o'hara , and posey are all wonderful and definitely should be commended for their performances ! if there was an oscar for an ensemble performance , this is the group that should sweep it .
some humor was a tad uneven from the rest of the film and , even after starting very humorously , they nearly lost me with the tad - too - long intros . as delightful as it was , it began to get monotonous .
thankfully , just as your about to say "" ok , maybe i should run to the bathroom "" , they finally get past the intros and onto the rehearsal scenes .
like a play , this film gives a very three - act feel , the intros ( funny , but almost too long ) , the rehearsals ( even funnier ) , and finally , the actual performance of the play ( excellent ! ) .
like i said , each character really shines , even when done with a subtle approach .
you ca n't really watch these people and not think they 're real people !
even they way they talk , with awkward pauses and stumbles that do n't feel staged at all , you feel like you 're watching a real , albeit funny , documentary .
and even with silly lyrics , the original songs when the play is finally put on , are absolutely wonderful !
as a word of note , despite it 's "" r "" rating , waiting for guffman is really quite clean .
this rating came from a brief , very brief use of the grand - daddy of all swear words .
even if that really bothers you , let me say that it 's not presented in a vulgar , cheap - laugh way .
it 's actually quite humorous and tastefully done !
it might be hard knowing what to expect with waiting for guffman .
it 's silly humor , but it 's also so dry , subtle , and intelligently done that you 're not insulted by it .
it 's always really nice to see a comedy that is n't all slapstick and vulgarity , and this film is one of the better ones of the better ones !
i 'd recommend seeing it !",1,"['after starting very humorously', 'stands out', 'had as many "" laugh - out - loud "" moments', ""you feel like you 're watching a real , albeit funny , documentary"", ""it 's actually quite humorous and tastefully done"", ""i 'd recommend seeing it !"", 'excellent !', 'if there was an oscar for an ensemble performance , this is the group that should sweep it', 'even funnier', 'funny', 'is a really good sign', 'this film is one of the better ones of the better ones', 'are absolutely wonderful', 'everybody in this movie is brilliant , absolutely so , but levy particularly stands out', 'my mouth burst open with at least a delighted guffaw at least every couple of minutes', 'are all wonderful and definitely should be commended for their performances', 'intelligently done']"
"starship troopers is a bad movie .
i mean , a really , really , bad movie .
not only does it cross the line of bad taste
when it comes to blood , gore and body parts shown on the screen , it blissfully jumps over that line , apparently unaware that the movie trailers appeal to an audience of five to fifteen year olds ( of which i saw many in the theatre ) . looking past the appalling sight of overdone violence
, we are left with a movie with a thin plot at best , no strong lead characters , a blatant disregard for physics , and a very obvious naziesque theme .
that being said , onto the review : the movie starts with a propaganda message from the federation ( who 's logo bears a * strong * resemblance to a nazi german eagle ) , urging the populace to go off and fight the bugs , who are attempting to destroy earth .
the film shows large rallies with young children in attendance , pledging allegiance to the federation ( again , sound familiar ? ) . as the movie progresses , we are shown terror tactic training , as a drill sargeant very graphically compound fractures one recruits arm , and throws a knife through another 's hand .
eventually , the recruits embark on a journey to a location two thirds of the way across the milky way galaxy , to fight the bugs on their home planet .
as our faster than light travelling "" heroes "" arrive on planet , they drop onto the planet , and burst our of their craft brandishing . . .
"" what ?
""
you say , "" laser beam weapons ?
sonic weapons ?
phasers ?
photon cannons ? ""
.
nope , they hop out brandishing good old 1997 machine guns , pump action rifles , and tactical nuclear weapons !
i guess a lot of physics money r&d went into travel and not weaponry .
as the assault begins , our group of troopers are seen walking in a straight line through a box canyon .
two members of the group notice rocks slipping and falling above them , and one even sees a streak fly by , but disregards it as nothing .
this of course , leads to more massive carnage , blood shed , and graphic depictions of limbs and heads being ripped and severed from their bodies .
again , i see that military tactics in the future must have evolved at about the same pace as their weapons !
in the end , we see neil patrick "" doogie howser "" harris burst onto the scene in what could accurately be described as a nazi ss trenchcoat , hat , and gloves .
he does a vulcan mind meld on the giant slug , and then proclaims that the bugs are scared !
this sets the troopers into a frenzy , as they are now one step closer to completing their goal , total genocide of a species ( again , sound familiar ? ? ) .
i have tried very hard not to step on and spoil the plot with this review , but
given it 's non - existence , i may have anyway .
i could go on for pages ripping this movie apart , but do n't want to bore you too badly
.
in short , i felt as if i were subjected to a mix between a pro - nazi war film with bugs substituted for allies , a drivers education accident scene film , and a complete blank screen ( the plot , of course ) .
i would n't recommend this movie to anyone , anywhere , under any circumstance .

"it seems that i 've stopped enjoying movies that should be fun to watch .
take payback , for example , a movie that most people seem to like . however ,
it 's horrible schlock , straight out of hollywood 's vast talent for sucking creativity out of movies .
it was written and directed by a guy who should have done better ; however , maybe he did do better , after all , 30 percent of the movie is n't his own .
mel gibson ,
that hollywood zombie
, decided he did n't like the ending and had another director reshoot it .
what a crock . if you sign on to do a movie , then do it the way the script calls for .
why film a movie and then look at it later and say , - no , i changed my mind , i do n't like the ending .
you 're fired .
let 's get someone else to do it .
- i suppose honor is dead in hollywood .
the end of the film is , of course , hollywoodized . which is to say that it 's happy and the guy you root for beats impossible odds to win his prize .
in this case , as is most victories in hollywood movies , gibson 's prize is a blond and money .
i miss originality in film , i really do .
i think audiences are so starved for it that they 'll flop down a lot of money in hopes that a movie will be original .
payback 's tagline - get ready to root for the bad guy - promised an original idea , but it was far from the truth .
while gibson 's character certainly broke the law , he was a character that had honor ( odd that gibson himself seems to have very little of it ) , would n't kill in front of children and protects his blond woman .
there 's nothing bad about him - he 's a hollywood character , a person who could never exist in real life .
and gibson knows it - he spends his time trying to act like a "" bad guy "" , and instead comes off as pretentious and arrogant .
the story involves gibson being double - crossed by his partner ( who is a real bad guy , which made me wish that we could root for him ) over $ 70 , 000 .
gibson recovers from multiple gunshots , is pissed ( naturally ) , and will do whatever it takes to get the exact amount of money back - no more , no less .
he makes a point of it that it 's strictly 70 grand .
a real bad guy would have made his ex - partner pay 25 % interest .
this idea is completely stretched out .
gibson ends up going after his partner and the chicago mafia that his partner is affiliated with .
what i did n't understand -
this is the chicago mafia .
$ 70 , 000 is like spare change to them .
they 'd probably just pay the guy rather than go through the trouble of dealing with him .
i think they 'd respect a guy going through this much trouble for a simple $ 70 , 000 .
maybe i 'm being too hard on the movie .
perhaps the filmmakers were just trying to make a simple popcorn movie .
i read roger ebert 's review and he liked gibson in the role because he is a comic at heart playing a bad guy .
that 's why we 're allowed to root for him .
and it 's true - gibson walks the movie as if he 's smiling at a joke he just heard .
but he 's wrong here .
i wanted a lee marvin or old - time clint eastwood or somebody who was n't a comic , just an ass kicker .
as a side note , i 've just checked the internet movie database and discovered that i am the 38th person to post a newsgroup review of payback .
after this many reviews , why would anyone want to read this ?

"star wars : episode
i - the phantom menace review a review by jamey hughton stars ) starring - liam neeson , ewan mcgregor , natalie portman and jake lloyd director - george lucas rated g with all the hype that star wars : episode 1-
the phantom menace has been receiving , it seems almost impossible to avoid interest in seeing the film .
the movie is easily the most anticipated motion picture ever , with a marketing campaign so strong it has brought colonel sanders , the taco bell chihuahua and pizza hut together .
can george lucas succeed yet again with transporting us back a long time ago , in a galaxy far , far away . . . . ?
yes .
this star wars prequel may be the worst of the bunch , with amateurish dialogue and an overall lack of humanity .
but that does n't mean it fails to comply on the basis of solid entertainment .
the phantom menace features the most eye - catching , jaw - dropping visual look in cinematic history .
the tremendous action sequences will have you clinging to your arm rest , and the special effects are nothing short of the best
( and most plentiful ) to ever be caught on film .
the vast digitized worlds and sheer imagination that was applied to this project is astounding .
the phantom menace is a delectable feast for the senses , even if it has some disappointing aspects .
after we 're treated to the famous prologue in the sky , with john williams ' thundering score , we meet qui - gon jonn ( liam neeson ) and young obi - wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) , a jedi master and his trainee ` padawan ' .
they are on the ship accommodating the fleet headquarters for the evil trade federation , and have been sent to settle disputes regarding the taxation of trade routes to the planet of naboo .
oh ,
but enough about that .
the prime concern for this prequel is introducing young anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) into the picture .
as you already know , this seemingly charming lad is the boy who will soon become darth vader .
a spectacular pod race comes soon hereafter .
this particular race is the most exciting , energetic , high - octane action sequence that you 'll ever see .
one of the delights of the series is meeting the newest set of strange alien creatures that lucas has devised , and the phantom menace is no exception .
i loved sebulba , the rat - like scoundrel whom anakin has to face in the pod race , and boss nass , the leader of the gungans ( who are a neighbouring species to naboo ) .
one character who has been subject to criticism is jar - jar binks , a member of the gungan race .
jar - jar speaks like roger rabbit on a hallucinogenic drug , and is there for the sole purpose of supplying comic relief .
yes , he is initially annoying , but i can admit to laughing over some of his harmless , goofy antics .
there is some lack of dramatic pull in this star wars entry , but the presentation almost makes you forget the plot and character lapses .
the final light - saber battle , between the jedi 's and the horrific ( and terminally underused ) villain darth maul , is spectacular to behold .
jabba the hutt , yoda , c-3po and r2-d2 have cameo appearances .
lucas has not forget how to captivate an audience , even if his latest shows obvious signs of tiredness .
one can only wonder what the possible technology will present for the next two installments , episode 's i and ii .
when they arrive , you 'll know where to find me .",1,"['nothing short of the best', 'a delectable feast', 'eye - catching , jaw - dropping visual look', 'will have you clinging to your arm rest', 'tremendous', ""the most exciting , energetic , high - octane action sequence that you 'll ever see"", ""that does n't mean it fails to comply on the basis of solid entertainment"", 'astounding', 'spectacular to behold']"
"the heartbreak kid ( reviewed on aug .
26th/1998 ) starring charles grodin , cybill sheppard , eddie albert in "" the heartbreak kid "" , charles grodin plays one of the most unbelievably obnoxious characters i 've seen on screen in a long time .
he 's a guy who spends virtually the entire running time of the movie bullshitting his way from one situation to another .
i doubt he ever expressed any genuine feeling at all during the film .
as the film opens , he has just gotten married , and is on the way to miami beach for his honeymoon .
halfway there , he begins to resent his bride .
by the time he arrives at his hotel and has met the cybill sheppard character , he is ready to divorce his wife .
as played by grodin , this character is the type of person that nothing will ever be good enough for him .
the phrase "" the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence "" was practically written with him in mind .
however , if he finds something he really wants , he will pursue it for as long as it takes .
the only problem is , once he has it , he immediately loses interest .
the end of "" the heartbreak kid "" is both hilarious and sad for that very reason .
charles grodin is at his smarmy best here , and sheppard is quite appealing as the object of grodin 's desire . however , the real scene stealer is jeannie berlin , daughter of director elaine may , as grodin 's whiny bride .
she owns every scene that she 's in , and makes you almost want to root for what the grodin character is trying to do .
""
the heartbreak kid "" was written by neil simon and it shows .
simon loves to deconstruct and analyze human relationships , and he 's at the top of his game here .
as maddeningly obnoxious as the grodin character is , he 's the type of guy that everyone knows .
the character of george costanza on "" seinfeld "" seems to have been modelled after him .
the only problem with the film is that it 's not that funny , and it 's billed as a comedy . as much as i could see the realism in the characters , it would have been nice to have a chuckle here and there .
""
the heartbreak kid "" is not a date movie .
it has an extremely negative view of relationships , so seeing it with a girlfriend / boyfriend , could be hazardus to your health .",1,"['quite appealing', 'is at his smarmy best here', 'the real scene stealer', ""he 's at the top of his game here""]"
"quaid stars as a man who has taken up the proffesion of dragonslayer after he feels he is betrayed by a dragon early in the movie .
he runs into the last dragon in existence , and there is a genuinely amusing battle between the two which results in a standoff where quaid is in the dragons mouth , but has his sword pointed at the dragons brain .
eventually , they decide to call a truce , and they work out a deal . since he is the last dragon , he will pretend to die and quaid will be able to get paid for it .
their scam works at first , until they come to a town without any money .
instead the town sacrifices a girl to the dragon , but of course , draco is a nice droagon
, so he wo n't eat her .
there is however a very amusing scene where draco is hitting on the young girl .
of course , as you can probably tell by the plot , this is a silly movie , but it does know when to take itself seriously at the right times , unlike eddie , which was serious all the time .
you could probably call this a medieval comedy , because there are more laughs here than in eddie and spy hard combined .
dennis quaid makes a fine hero .
pete posthlewaite provides some ghreat comedy as a monk who journeys with them .
dina meyer is appealing as the sacrificed girl .
but lets face it , the movie is really about the dragon , and what an amazing creation he is .
connery 's voice and ilm team up to provide us with a truly magnificent dragon
.
so , if you are going to see this movie for a strong hard core medieval epic , you are going to the wrong movie .
if you are going because of the dragon , you will not be dissapointed , and you will be provided with plenty of laughs

"susan granger 's review of "" america 's sweethearts "" ( columbia / sony ) what a waste of a talented cast !
billy crystal and co - writer peter tolan have concocted a sly , provocative premise and , as the opening credits roll , it 's obvious that they 're attempting an old - fashioned romantic comedy .
the story involves a veteran publicist ( billy crystal ) who is summoned to orchestrate a press junket in las vegas when an arrogant director ( christopher walken ) holds a megabuck movie hostage in his editing room , refusing to show it to anyone .
he figures that by giving the journalists juicy hints of a possible reconciliation between the film 's once - married - but - now - estranged stars , gwen and eddie ( catherine zeta - jones , john cusack ) , they 'll be so distracted that they wo n't remember they did n't see the movie or
it was n't what they expected .
( and crystal thought of this long before a sony exec concocted the phony critic / david manning quote scandal ! )
for help , he turns to gwen 's personal assistant / sister ( julia roberts ) .
but the laughs are few and far - between .
crystal 's glib , cynical flack is n't wickedly funny enough with a few amusing one - liners .
after six months under the care of a depak chopra - like guru ( alan arkin ) , cusack 's character 's too emotionally fragile , lacking the necessary charisma .
zeta - jones 's vain , narcissistic diva is undeveloped and one - dimensional .
only hank azaria , as zeta - jones 's much - macho spanish lover , and stanley tucci , as a studio exec , and roberts manage to whip up any farcical froth .

fifth grader joshua beal ( joseph cross )

his beloved grandfather ( robert loggia ) has died , and joshua has begun a quest .

however , it deals with serious issues , and is likely to be boring for today 's instant - gratification kids .

the actors who might have created a great cast ( o'donnell , leary and delany ) are wasted in roles that amount to little more than cameos .

"coinciding with the emerging popularity of movies that deal with anything related to serial killers , relentless , 1989 low budget thriller about lapd detective sam dietz , played by character actor leo rossi , spawned three more sequels . relentless 3 , third in the row , features sam dietz again , but this time detective , who had to catch vicious serial killer in his very first case , does n't want to deal with similar line of work .
divorced , demoralised and transferred , he reluctantly returns to his old post when los angeles becomes a hunting ground for another serial killer , and evidence indicate connection with one of dietz 's old cases .

"the long and illustrious career of robin williams , which has included both forgettable turns like mrs .
doubtfire and flubber , was punctuated with the actor 's first academy award in 1998 for his role in good will hunting .
it was his first truly dramatic role since 1989 's dead poets society , and critical remarks were unanimously positive .
his next role , that of a deceased pediatrician in what dreams may come , was unfortunately lackluster .
and so , after a six - year stint as a comedic actor , the proof on whether or not williams can cut it in the dramatic league has come down to patch adams .
williams is the title character , hunter "" patch "" adams , sporting scruffy facial hair that falls between the clean - shavenness of dreams and the grotesque hairiness of will hunting .
we 're introduced to patch as he commits himself to a mental institution because of his suicidal tendancies .
it 's at the institution , however , that he discovers a latent talent for relating to people .
he removes himself from the institution and enrolls at the university of virginia 's medical college , where he finds that medical doctrine is a calculating , impersonal trade .
his attempts to inject humanity into the profession result in several bouts with expulsion , and the movie climaxes with patch 's appearance before the state medical board .
the characters are well - defined in an oscar - worthy sense .
although the script does not perform well as a narrative -- there 's little story to be told outside of patch 's skit - length experiences -- the script does go a long way toward building the relationships of characters .
at medical school , patch meets up with truman schiff ( daniel london ) , an outsider like himself who relishes patch 's zest for humanity .
the two instantly become the best of friends , and it 's easy to see why .
monica potter plays patch 's love interest , a young woman who personifies the things that patch hates about medical school .
for some reason he 's attracted to her , and although it never gets said , the audience understands from an intrinsic point of view .
the script -- based on hunter adams ' own story -- works well this way .
the rest of the cast , bob gunton as the villain professor in particular , is solid .

"play it to the bone is a punch - drunk mess of a movie . containing a good cast but awful acting ; an interesting premise but terrible execution , ron shelton ( white men ca n't jump ) gives us a rocky story with not one rocky
but two .
rocky no .
1 is vince boudreau ( woody harrelson , edtv ) , a bald , tattooed , newly converted christian , whose idea of christianity is not using the name of christ as a curse word .
. .
something that he has not yet successfully achieved .
rocky no . 2 is caesar dominguez ( antonio banderas , the 13th warrior ) , best friend of vince who is currently dating vince 's ex - girlfriend , grace .
both men are nearing the end of their "" almost "" careers when a fluke provides them with a redemptive opportunity .
when both fighters of the undercard of a vegas based mike tyson title fight become incapacitated , the fight promoters need to find a quick replacement .
our boys are tapped to fight each other , the winner of which is "" promised "" a shot at a future title fight .
the film is divided into two sections .
at first , we have a buddy road picture as our two heroes , in grace 's "" sassy grassy "" green muscle car , travel through the desert to vegas in order to make the fight scheduled for that day .
along the way we learn about their pasts and the opportunities that have come and gone by .
once in vegas , the movie settles down to the effectively staged fight sequences between vince and caesar .
both mr .
harrelson and mr .
banderas have provided us with stunning characterizations in the past ,
not that we 'd know it from their work here .
mr .
harrelson is uncomfortably awkward , apparently never having gotten a firm handle on vince .
the christian conversion angle simply falls flat and unbelievable .
mr .
banderas is uncharacteristically non - charismatic as caesar .
weak and ineffectual , there is little life in his screen performance .
the other actors involved merely play stereotypes of one sort or another .
tom sizemore ( saving private ryan ) , robert wagner ( austin powers ii : the spy who shagged me ) , and richard masur ( fire down below ) are crooked promoters , lucy
liu ( payback ) is a sex - starved hitchhiker looking for a good time , and lolita davidovich ( gods and monsters ) , is the shared girlfriend who ca n't make her mind up which boxer she prefers .
because of the weak characters and the lack of screen chemistry between them , the film flounders with all the appeal of a dead fish until the boxing match actually begins .
but even then , because the outcome is so predictably obvious , the suspense factor is negated and we are relegated to just watching two men pummel each other .
writer / director ron shelton clearly spent much time orchestrating the fight sequence as it is well photographed , well - choreographed , well - edited , and well - performed .
if only some of that same detailed attention had been diverted to the remaining parts of the film .
as it is , the scenes which require the characters to actually talk to one another are weak and laughable .
the title is actually the most interesting aspect of the film .
the phrase , "" play it to the bone ' is a reference to seeing something all the way through or not quitting until you 've achieved your desired goal .
that is a biblical principle .

"not since oliver stone 's natural born killers has there been a movie this incendiary , and not since david cronenberg has a so - called mainstream director been this willing to repeatedly tiptoe the fine line between pointed social commentary and outright social irresponsibility .
while fincher 's films have never suffered from a lack of shock value ( his major character killings in both alien 3 and seven are fine examples ) , fight club marks the distillation of his pitch - black comedic sensibility ( see 1997 's the game ) into something like a definitive statement .
jack ( norton , acting as both narrator and protagonist ) is your typical cubicle clone , whose disillusionment is amplified by a seemingly incurable insomnia .
on the offhand advice of a doctor , he sits in on group - therapy sessions for everything from blood parasites to testicular cancer .
here he meets bob ( marvin lee aday , aka meat loaf ) , a cancer - emasculated eunuch with profound gynecomastia .
strangely , the release he finds while sobbing on bob 's breasts allows him to sleep at night , at least until a fellow group - therapy "" tourist "" named marla singer ( carter ) comes along to ruin things for him , forcing a grudging compromise that recalls monty python in its dark hilarity .
later , he meets tyler durden ( pitt ) , a soap salesman with a decidedly subversive outlook on life .
one night , after his ikea- furnished condo explodes ( do n't ask--
you 'll just have to see the movie , awright ? ) , he is goaded by tyler into a fight , and damned if it does n't feel good .
it is pure , raw existence , a brief moment of clarity and purpose that makes his dreary workaday life pale in comparison .
he moves into tyler 's squalid abandoned mansion , and they form the titular organization , an underground therapy group where men bond with bare - knuckle savagery and very few rules , the first two of which are "" do n't talk about fight club .
"" armed with charisma and an attractive anti - corporate philosophy , tyler assumes leadership of the burgeoning membership of white - collar slaves and dead - end mcemployees .
resentment creeps into jack 's heart , made worse by the fact that tyler is also regularly and noisily boffing the hated marla .
funded by a frivolous lawsuit , tyler begins molding his devotees into an army dedicated to mischief and mayhem .
their initially juvenile pranks ( like pissing in food and putting spike belts on roads ) quickly evolve into something more like sedition , and jack fears that things have gone sour .
it is after this point , when you are plenty uncomfortable and wondering just how far fincher will go to say something original , that the film uncorks a disappointing plot twist .
it is so contrived-- and so conventional compared to what precedes it-- that everything which follows ( including the ending ) becomes far less interesting .
it 's a major ( though not fatal ) flaw , and for a director as notoriously unpredictable as fincher , it feels like a cop - out .
fight club is going to be misconstrued by a great many people .
in the early going , it has a downright dangerous feel ; it seems to be saying that violence and civil disobedience are good for the soul , and this is undoubtedly the message that a few moronic punks are going to take from it .
i 'll be mightily surprised if imitation fight clubs do n't spring up here and there , and i 'll be even more amazed if fincher is n't vilified for it by the same humorless witch - hunters that are currently after oliver stone .
they need n't bother , because fight club is less a message movie than fincher 's elaborate attempt at a joke .
tyler durden , for all his dionysian allure , is really nothing more than the logical ( and far less hypocritical ) extrapolation of all those self - help gurus who constantly show up on oprah to preach their me - first gospel of self - actualization .
in this context , the joke works , but like the latest columbine joke , some people will get it and enjoy a good laugh , and others wo n't .
hopefully , though , their silly moral outrage wo n't spoil the joke for the rest of us .",1,"[""marks the distillation of his pitch - black comedic sensibility ( see 1997 's the game ) into something like a definitive statement"", 'the joke works']"
"towards the middle of "" the sweet hereafter , "" a crowded school bus skids on an icy road surface as it rounds a bend , careens through the steel guard rail , and disappears out of sight .
then , in long shot , we see the vehicle slowly sliding across what looks like a snow - covered field .
it pauses for a moment before the "" field "" cracks under the bus ' weight and the bright yellow vehicle vanishes in an effortless moment , a single smooth second of time .
compare that scene , if you will , to the last eighty minutes of "" titanic , "" when the behemoth sinks slowly and spectacularly to its watery demise , and you 'll appreciate the futility of comparing greatness in films .
the scene in "" the sweet hereafter "" epitomizes all that 's right with independent canadian director atom egoyan 's film .
it 's not sensational .
we do n't see the inside of the bus with its payload of screaming , terrified children being bloodied and battered about .
the bus does n't explode or break into a thousand tiny pieces .
it simply leaves the road and silently slips beneath the surface of a frozen lake .
it 's a horrifying sequence made all the more so by calm and distance .
using a non - linear approach to his narrative , egoyan shifts back and forward in time , connecting us with the inhabitants of the small british columbian town who have been severely affected by this tragedy .
fourteen children died in the accident , leaving their parents and the town itself paralyzed with grief .
the catalyst at the center of the film is ambulance chaser mitchell stephens ( a wonderfully moving performance by ian holm ) , who comes to sam dent to persuade the townsfolk to engage in a class action suit .
stephens , who "" does n't believe in accidents , "" functions as a concerned , involved observer , scribbling details in his notebook and providing the parents with an opportunity to reach some kind of closure in the harrowing aftermath .
while stephens ' initial drive may be financial ( one third of the total settlement if he wins ) , his involvement provides him more with an outlet to come to grips with his own loss .
his self - destructive , drug - addicted daughter has been in and out of clinics , halfway houses and detox units for years .
egoyan 's attention to detail and ability to establish mood are so impeccable
that even the sound of a kettle boiling resonates like a plaintive cry .
mychael danna , who composed the shimmering music for "" the ice storm , "" contributes another memorable score that shivers and tingles .
equally impressive is paul sarossy 's cinematography , capturing the imposing canadian mountainsides and low - hanging fogs as splendidly as his shadowy interiors -- in one scene a bright wall calendar serves to illuminate portions of a room .
""
the sweet hereafter , "" while undeniably grim , urges the viewer to grab onto life with both hands and not let go .
it 's a film of generous subtlety and emotion .",1,"[""urges the viewer to grab onto life with both hands and not let go . it 's a film of generous subtlety and emotion"", 'splendidly', 'contributes another memorable score that shivers and tingles . equally impressive', 'attention to detail and ability to establish mood are so impeccable']"
"plot : something about a bunch of kids going into a haunted house and playing out parodies of other horror and non - horror movies .
oh yeah , there 's also something about a ghost possessing the mansion and shit , but trust me
, you wo n't care much about the "" plot "" in this film . . .
critique : parody movies either work
or they do n't and
this one just does n't work !
the laughs are n't as pronounced this time around , the energy level , the gags and all of the characters just seem to be going through the motions here .
it 's like they were all in a hurry to finish the film or something ( wink , wink ) .
and the scariest part of it all ?
check out the number of screenwriters it took to pen this puppy : seven !
i say again , it took seven people to write 82-minutes worth of fart jokes , half - assed stunts and spoofs of films other than horror .
now i 'm not exactly sure if each of the writers wrote their own parts separately or just tossed
"" funny sketch "" ideas out there while smoking the chronic themselves , but the end result is a film that basically plays out like an extended skit on "" saturday night live "" .
there are a couple of funny one - liners , but mostly just rehashed one - joke scenes , a lot of dead silence and lame gags .
add to that the very unoriginal title and movie poster
and you got ta start asking yourself if anybody was even trying here ( the film 's website is n't even up yet ! ! !
what the f
*
* * ? ! ? ) .
i do however have to give it up to james woods , the man who opens up this movie with the funniest parody of them all ( the exorcist take - off-- miss this
and you 've missed any reason to see the flick ) .
i especially liked his one - liner as he walked in to see the possessed woman 's head turning .
very funny !
unfortunately , the film plummets straight down after that , with dumb parodies of many teen flicks that have nothing to do with horror such as save the last dance and dude , where 's my car , and other action movies like charlie 's angels and mission impossible 2 .
now help me figure this one out , will you ?
is n't this supposed to be a parody film of horror movies ? ! ?
( or maybe that 's just the title of the film f - ing with my head ) .
well , i 'm sorry to have to say this but the only horror in this film is its lame - ass script
!
the wayans brothers should have known better than to look towards the weinstein brothers ( money ) instead of the zucker brothers ( comedy ) for this sequel .
unfortunately for us , all we 're left with here is a skeleton of a film which might 've been funny , had it been worked over a few more times , tightened up here and there , and been injected with more solid laughs .
but as things stand now , there is no doubt in my mind that the obvious greed to capitalize on the success of last year 's film has led everyone down this path , so screw them for not trying as hard ( critically speaking , of course ) .

"the booming introduction music finishes , and the camera sweeps over red mountains .
we see two figures looking over a barren , and very red landscape .
they kiss , then walk on .
one of the characters ( schwarzenegger ) slips , and falls .
the glass on his mask cracks .
his face scruches up , and his eye 's begin to pop . . . . .
then doug quaid , played by schwarzenegger , wakes up .
it 's all been a dream .
he wakes up next to his beautiful wife , played by stone , and the film begins . . .
total recall is a typical sci - fi film wrapped around an intresting ( if far fetched ) plot .
quaid , who has never been to mars , keeps on having dreams of the planet , which has now been colanised .
one day , while riding on a train , he 's see 's a ad for a company called ' rekall ' , which implants memories of a holiday , instead of you actually going there yourself .
quaid chooses the ' secret agent on mars ' memory , and then the s
*
* * really hits the fan .
the implant goes wrong , and quaid really thinks he is an agent on mars for about two minutes , until he goes back to normal and ca n't remember a thing .
however , everyone he knows ( his workmates , his wife ) turn against him , saying how ' blabbed about mars ' and ' blew his cover on the mission ' a strange man , called richter , played by ironside , wants to kill him .
quaid , now hopelessly confused , follows the advice given to him , by a ' friend ' .
he get 's his ass to mars .
mars is ruled by cohagen , played by cox , who charges people for air .
against him are the rebels , who are mainly mutants .
the rebel 's need quaid to defeat cohagen , because quaid knows ( but ca n't remember yet ) about a reactor that produces air .
eventually , quaid kills cohagen , turns on the reactor , saves the planet , and goes away with a beautiful girl , just like the guy at rekall promised him .
throughout this plot , there is huge explosions , thousands of deaths ( and i mean a lot of death ) swearing , sex , and everything else that make
's a good verhoeven ( director of basic instinct and starship troopers ) movie .
naturally , there 's some pretty imaginative deaths , with arms getting ripped off , someone getting drilled , and heads exploding .
as you can tell , it 's violent stuff .
but it 's done so stylishly , and of course arnie tones it down with a one liner
, that 's it excusable .
the acting is variable .
arnie , of course , is useless , but he goes has some good lines , and in the first twenty minutes , he even act 's like a normal bloke , not like some action hero .
stone , of course , is useless , making a pretty poor wife , and a pretty poor action hero .
but , she does sex scenes alright .
ticoton ( most recently seen in con air ) , again , is ok , doing some good action , but getting her emotions all wrong .
one minute she hates quaid , the next she loves him , and she never gets this tranisition right .
so , the good guys are awful .
but , the bad guy 's are excellent .
cox is basically reprising robocop , but he 's still great in this , and he delivers the best line in the whole film near the end .
ironside is superbly evil , with an utterly emotionless face .
the supporting cast are fine , and not even the comedy sidekick ( this time in the form of a taxi driver ) is annoying .
one disappointing aspect , though , are the special effects .
ilm and dreamquest
do some good work ( such as a subway station scene ) but the model work is not so good .
some of the model heads look appaling fake , and quatto is a major disappointment .
another irritating thing is the product placement .
there are a lot of plugs ( and a good mars today gag ) however ,
the sets look great , and the special effects at the end of the film are n't too bad either .
there 's also a good soundtrack running through , by jerry goldsmith ( the omen ,
poltergeist , star trek : the motion picture ) overall , then , total recall is a hugely violent , yet hugely enjoyable , action fest , with a reasonable plot thrown in there too , some great bad guys , and some imaganitive death .
for a schwarzenegger movie , this is not bad at all .
in fact , it 's very good .",1,"['she does sex scenes alright', ""the bad guy 's are excellent"", 'do some good work', 'doing some good action', ""he 's still great in this , and he delivers the best line in the whole film near the end"", ""it 's done so stylishly , and of course arnie tones it down with a one liner , that 's it excusable"", ""the sets look great , and the special effects at the end of the film are n't too bad either . there 's also a good soundtrack running through"", ""it 's very good"", 'the supporting cast are fine', 'hugely enjoyable']"
"plot outline - wendy ( samantha press ) , a jazz singer , loves mack ( hugo race ) a criminal and wanna be rock singer who 's planning a bank heist .
mack is also being tailed by a couple of cops , one an inexperienced rookie ( dominic sweeney ) , the other ( john flaus ) a worn out veteran who frequents wendy 's jazz club .
they 're tailing mack , because he has an audiotape that may show evidence of governmental corruption .
meanwhile wendy 's sexually awakener , fifteen year old sister ( rebecca elmaloglou ) has moved in with her , and is secretly watching mack and wendy 's late night love trysts ?
much zaniness ensues the review :
main problem first - about 2 % of rood rock star to actor conversions in filmdom ever really work .
unfortunately , trying to cast hugo race as a violent , sexy criminal falls into the "" what the hell where they thinking "" category
that takes up 98 % of the rest .
but , hell , it 's not as if he 's the only problem in this well - intentioned but ultimately below average aussie thriller .
leads , race and samantha press are wooden and dull , hampered by some unfortunate attempts at sexy dialogue early on .
though they do manage some heat later in their love scenes , helped , no doubt by them keeping their mouths shut .
the film suffers every time the story shifts back to these two . which is unfortunately , the other main story is n't any great shakes either .
the second part , concerning two cops , political corruption and that elusive tape is incredibly muddled .
at many points during the movie i had no idea what was going on , a situation that did n't improve on repeated viewing .
there is no doubt that this film 's achilles heel is its script .
as for the rest of the cast , it 's a mixed bag .
john flaus , one of australia 's most criminally underused actors , is in top form as the withering , alcoholic jazz fan cop , who may or may not have sold out to the highest bidder .
although he falters at one point , when the script calls for him to get up on stage and deliver a drunken beat sermon , but believe me , they way it was written , no one could have pulled it off .
dominic sweeney is fine , though he seems to be uneasy in front of the lens but he really is n't given a whole lot to do .
pre home and away elmaloglou is pretty good as the inquisitive jojo , but her character seems extraneous to the story , well , at least until the final scenes .
i must admit , in too deep does have some impressive qualities , not the least of which is it visual element .
cinematographers mark gilfedder & peter zakharov have achieved the almost impossible by making melbourne look like a sweat drenched tropic city , which is akin to turning london into san paolo .
the bar is an oppressive red , like all of it 's patrons are being baked while they drink , outside it hazy orange by day and cool blue by night .
if only deborah parson 's script could have supported this idea better .
having two director 's ( colin south & john tatoulis ) does n't help either , the most glaring example of which is the final retribution / fight scene , where for some reason the camera pulls away from the onscreen action , and more importantly it does n't pull away to anything else .
it just stays static as the fight happens in the distance .
it has no reason to it ; it 's just bad direction .
and , ultimately , that is what sums up in too deep
, it 's tries to be good , and you want it to work , but , it 's just lacking the talent behind it , that it needs to succeed .",0,"[""it has no reason to it ; it 's just bad direction"", ""does n't help either"", 'main problem first', 'falls into the "" what the hell where they thinking "" category', 'ultimately below average', ""it 's just lacking the talent"", 'wooden and dull', 'incredibly muddled', ""this film 's achilles heel is its script"", 'the film suffers', 'unfortunate attempts']"

rosemary 's baby stars mia farrow ( from the time she was actually good - looking ) as an innocent housewife and her not - so - innocent husband ( john cassavettes ) , an actor who takes an easy , albeit evil , road to success .

mia and john move into an apartment where several past murders have been committed .
( there 's also a skull in the living room , but it 's only for decoration . )
their elderly neighbors pop in for a housewarming .
all 's well for about the first hour of this slow - moving film , until mia eats some of the neighbors ' chocolate mousse and passes out .
when she comes to , she finds herself in a darkened room with a bunch of people yelling and dancing like savages and a big , evil man raping her -- a foreshadowing of her future life with woody allen .
it seems like a dream and , when she finds herself pregnant , she almost forgets about it .
and everyone 's helping with the pregnancy .
the neighbors have some wonderful vitamin potions for her to drink , a good - luck charm for her to wear around her neck , and the name of an obstetrician who 's been in the business 66 .

"the happy bastard 's 30-second review notting hill a cute romantic comedy from the writer of the hit comedy four weddings and a funeral , notting hill stars julia roberts as anna scott , a very popular actress with a $ 15 million asking price for movies .
one day she wanders into a travel book store owned by a simple london resident ( played by hugh grant ) , and sparks somehow begin to fly .

but as soon as kiefer sutherland began speaking the narrative monologue , describing "" the strangers "" and their reasons for contacting human beings , i was hooked .
there was something especially compelling about the nature of his voice .
i knew from the start that i was going to witness the actions of his character rather than the actor attempting the character .
sutherland played the role as a true veteran .
upon the completion of his monologue , the camera arrives on sutherland in such a fashion that you can only wonder how long alex proyas spent on cinematography .
i would imagine , for a film of this caliber , that maximum hours of work were spent where they were needed the most .
the film flowed beautifully .
as i was being taken through the intricate regions of the "" dark city "" , a clever plot began to unravel , to the point where the last time i had seen such clever plot twists were in "" the usual suspects "" .
not to mention a series of special effects that would make james cameron literally turn green with envy .
but if you 're not exactly the biggest sci - fi fan , caveat emptor . get ready for the atmostpheric darkness of "" 12 monkeys "" or "" the crow "" without the boredom or depression .
the concept of the plot is as mindstretching as "" 12 monkeys "" was , however , so be prepared and be sophisticated .
and imagine a picture that finally does justice to the comic - book - gone - feature - film fad that hollywood has recently become abusive of .
dark city simply puts "" spawn "" to shame .

"historical epic as a genre was almost banished from hollywood in early 1990s .
for many critics , scholars and , most importantly , film producers , it was a thing of the past - something that could have attracted crowds only in the era of black - and - white television and non - cgi special effects .
but in 1995 , same as in the case of dances with wolves five years ago , there came the man who decided to use of all his energy and talents of actor , producer and director in order to revitalise that particular genre .

in his time , english king edward i "" longshanks "" (

although english had killed his father many years ago , young scottish commoner william wallace ( played by mel gibson ) does n't care about politics and wants only to have peaceful life with his new bride murron ( played by catherine maccormack ) .
murron 's death changes that and wallace takes arms and , together with small but dedicated band of followers , begins guerrilla campaign that would systematically destroy almost every english garrison in the country .
through time , more and more people join his ranks and in 1298 wallace 's rag - tag army scores surprising victory against english knights in the battle of stirling bridge .
but the newly won freedom is endangered by the internal squabbles between scots themselves , especially nobles under pretender robert the bruce ( played by angus macfadyen ) , who would n't like to have a simple commoner as a national leader .
braveheart was only the second film in the directorial career by mel gibson , so it would n't be fair to compare it to the better known genre classics directed by david lean or anthony mann .
however , even when we apply such criteria braveheart is more than decent historical epic that takes new and refreshing approach to the genre .
the most noticeable element of this approach is naturalism .
while older hollywood films set in medieval europe used to give fairytale - like vision of picturesque castles , splendid costumes and knights in shining armour , gibson shows us the extremely unpleasant world of poverty and feudal injustice where might made right and life was hard , short and brutish .
this general unpleasantness is especially underlined in the scenes of battle , where hand - to - hand combat is naturalistically displayed in all its gory details , never seen since verhoeven 's ultra - naturalistic flesh & blood .
compared with this naturalistic approach , most of old hollywood epics look like stage plays .
braveheart also employs humour at the right places , not only to make bloody realities of medieval british isles more bearable to sensitive audiences , but also to underline its down - to - earth atmosphere , so different from previous historical epics .
what makes braveheart "" larger than life "" is his protagonist .
mel gibson obviously invested plenty of his energy and talent in bringing the mythical figure of william wallace and , as a result , character of 15th century poems is transformed into superhuman being that resembles late 20th century comic book hero .
wallace is more than superior to his enemies , both physically and mentally , yet he is able to show his sensitive , more vulnerable side .
naturally , when the character is based on epic poems , most of historical accuracy is going down the drain ( which was the case with almost every historical epic from hollywood in 1990s ) .
however , even those who do n't particularly care about history or are willing to give poetic license to scriptwriter randall wallace might think that he went over the top in idolising wallace , especially in the second part of film when scottish superhero manages to seduce princess isabel ( played by sophie marceau ) and make her a child .
because of that the disbelief is hardly suspended , and final scenes are n't as effective as they should be .
mel gibson as an actor is truly wonderful , and he is also helped by small army of very good british and irish actors .
most memorable of them all is patrick mcgoohan , whose cold , calculated and evil medieval monarch is one of the most effective villains seen in contemporary cinema .
brendan gleeson ( who would later become famous for his role in boorman 's general ) is also very good
as wallace 's trusted companion , as well as ian bannen is effective as leprosy - stricken king john balliol .
david o'harra is very entertaining as wallace 's irish ally , and angus macfadyen brings a lot of anxiety into his conscience - stricken character of robert the bruce .
women in this film have rather thankless roles , especially marceau as one - dimensional french princess .
catherine mccormack as wallace 's wife was more interesting , but she was eliminated from the picture early on .
from the technical point of view , the film is also very good .
photography by john toll brings a lot of scottish natural beauty to the screen .
on the other hand , the musical score by james horner employs too much of modern - day instruments for period piece set in medieval times .
although mostly welcomed by critics and audiences alike , braveheart was often criticised for homophobia and other forms of extreme conservatism .
the main reason for that was the fact that gibson , among many historical facts , chose to be faithful only to those related to sexual orientation of "" longshank "" 's son prince edward ( played by peter hanly ) .
he is not only presented as a villain , but also as one of the less competent in villain 's camp - and portraying of homosexuals as villains or inferior to heterosexuals is almost unforgivable sin in "" politically correct "" hollywood . to make things even more obvious , good guys in this film are the total opposite of effeminate and incompetent edward - rugged macho men of mountains who are more practical and efficient because they tend to employ conservatives ' common sense instead of fashionable theories of ivory tower liberals .
however , although the message of this film might look right - wing , it owes more to leftist ideology of various national liberation movements in 20th century .
according to that ideology , oppressed classes ( workers , peasants ) are better suited to fight for national freedom because their members has less to lose in that struggle and , as such , they are more radical , less willing to make compromises and more efficient ; on the other hand , privileged classes ( aristocracy , bourgeoisie ) are more likely to betray the cause of freedom and be in cahoots with foreign oppressors in order to keep their privileges .
this marxist worldview is presented in braveheart without any subtlety .
in the end , whether the audience is patient enough to discover hidden meanings or simply wants to enjoy entertaining historical epic , braveheart is more than adequate choice for all fans of this recently resurrected genre .",1,"['the film is also very good', 'more than decent', 'more than adequate choice', 'also very good', 'truly wonderful', 'very good british and irish actors', 'one of the most effective villains', 'takes new and refreshing approach']"
"for a good ten years or so , super cool chow yun fat has enjoyed god hood status in the hong kong action scene .
now , he has followed in the footsteps of director john woo , ( who launched chow 's super stardom in the acclaimed ' a better tomorrow ' ) by moving to hollywood .
i had some reservations about this move and it would seem i was right to have them .
chow plays a hitman who is doing jobs in order to repay a debt .
his final job requires him to kill a policeman 's seven year old boy .
this he refuses do and runs .
however , he is forced into a violent confrontation when his family are threatned and replacement killers are brought in to do the job .
cue around 80 minutes of various and quite frankly tedious shoot- outs which take place in various locations .
some thought had gone into making them a bit different but
unfortunately they end up being just plain boring .
the car wash scene
, i found myself laughing at how stupid it looked .
tut tut .
the emphasis during the constant action seemed to be on the accompanying music ,
( i could have sworn one piece was ripped out of a bruckheimer movie ) and not on the content .
mia sorvino ( a passport forger ) is dragged into the affay and also provides a lame love interest as well as being rather handy with a gun .
director antoine arqua has clearly not observed chow 's excellent acting capabilties and simply requires him to mutter a few lines of broken english and look flash as he stands and shoots .
chow 's trademark of twin pistol shooting is saved for the finale ( which in fairness is quite good ) and there 's not even a toothpick in site .
and as for making chow shoot like a cop , well that 's damned unforgiveable . to round up , the replacement killers is a pretty darned lame first outing for chow .
it would appear he has left asia for a 90 minute pop video .
this is not what we wanted at all , considering john woo was the exec producer .
( did he have no say so at all ?
) watch ' the killer ' again and weep at the difference .

"when quentin tarantino made "" pulp fiction "" , he was not only making the greatest film of the 90s ; he was also making what i believe to be the most influential movie of all time .
but before you send me hate - mail for not giving that title to "" citizen kane "" , hear me out .
much like "" citizen kane "" , "" pulp fiction "" has changed movie making forever .
but i think the latter has had a tad more impact .
"" pulp fiction "" has actually ushered in a new era of film making .
it has altered the way films will be viewed .
"" fiction "" has spawned so many imitations , i 've lost count .
sure , some have been excellent ( "" bound "" and "" the usual suspects "" spring immediately to mind ) , but any serious movie - goer recognizes "" pulp fiction "" as the original neo - noir of
the 90s . in this review , i hope to change all the people 's minds who have criticized it for it 's excessive profanity and violence ( which , by the way , is n't really that graphic ) .
the most brilliant aspect of tarantino 's masterpiece is the screenplay .
it is filled with so much classic dialogue ( the "" quarter pounder with cheese "" speech will go down in history ) , it should be required reading for any film student , if it is n't already .
the story ( told in unorthodox non - linear format ) centers around three main episodes , all of which eventually intertwine .
the first , titled "" vincent vega and marcellus wallace 's wife "" , deals with a very loaded john travolta ( i forgot to mention the cool heroin shoot - up sequence ) taking mia wallace ( a star - making performance by uma thurman ) , his bosses wife , out on a date to a cool 50s restaurant called jack rabbit slim 's .
they talk for a while ( with the occasional "" uncomfortable silence "" ) , mostly about a guy called tony rocky horror .
after giving marcellus ' new bride a foot massage , he was thrown off a building and into a greenhouse , giving him a "" speech impediment "" .
they also partake in a cool dance contest and end up twisting to the chuck berry classic "" you never can tell "" .
i wo n't reveal the rest of the story , but i 'll definitely say that it turns out to be a real bummer of a night , despite the cool trophy they win .
the second story ( the least of the three but still four stars ) stars bruce willis ( proving he can play someone other than john mcclain in the "" die hard "" flicks ) as boxer butch coolidge .
previously in the film ( like i said , it 's told in non - linear form ) , he had made a deal with marcellus wallace that he would take a fall in a match .
as it turns out , he not only does n't take the fall , but he ends up actually killing his opponent .
he takes a cab to his half - witted girlfriend 's apartment , and to make a long story short , ends up going back to his own place to retrieve a gold watch , sort of a family heirloom explained by christopher walken in a hilarious flash - back sequence .
on his way home , he bumps into ( literally ) marcellus .
the two winde up prisoner to two hillbilly sex murderers , which results in the infamous "" gimp "" scene , which is very reminicent of the "" squeal like a pig !
"" scene from "" deliverance "" .
the last ( and best , in my opinion ) of the episodes features john travolta ( again ) and samuel l . jackson ( in the best performance of any supporting actor ever )
as two slightly off - kilter hitmen trying to rid themselves of a bloody car .
they seek help with a friend of jackson 's ( played by the q - man himself ) , desperately in need of a stress ball .
they end up calling a "" cleaner "" of sorts , played by the god among men harvey keitel , to help them out .
in the end , the story brilliantly loops around itself , actually ending where it began .
if you have n't already seen the film ( or even if you have , for that matter ) , i suggest you invest your money in a copy of the letterbox collectors edition .
it features two previously unreleased scenes and the original film restored how it was originally meant to be seen .
earlier today , i bought this version and watched it a few hours ago .
what the pan - and - scan did to this movie is inexcusable .
that version cut out , like , half the movie .
what i have missed in the past years of viewing this flick is amazing .
for instance , when travolta and jackson are in the apartment near the end , the widescreen version allows you to see that several things on the walls make crosses .
this might help explain the divine intervention that takes place .
just a theory . . .
one of the things that pisses people off so much about this movie is that tarantino borrowed alot of scenes from other movies ( i .
e .
"" psycho "" "" kiss me deadly "" , "" deliverance "" , etc . ) .
but why should n't he ?
it 's not like he out - right and blatantly stole .
give the guy a break .
in case you have n't already noticed , i believe "" pulp fiction "" is a supremely excellent film and one of the best of all time
( up there with such greats as "" casablanca "" and "" the godfather "" ) .
trust me ,
you will not see a better film come out of the 90s .
and besides , it 's one hell of a ride .
note :
if anyone knows how i could get a "" bad motherfucker "" wallet , please e - mail me .
any help would be greatly appreciated .",1,"['making the greatest film of the 90s ; he was also making what i believe to be the most influential movie of all time', 'you will not see a better film come out of the 90s', 'god among men', 'ushered in a new era of film making . it has altered the way films will be viewed', 'one hell of a ride', 'filled with so much classic dialogue', 'a hilarious', 'a supremely excellent film and one of the best of all time', ""the most brilliant aspect of tarantino 's masterpiece"", 'has changed movie making forever', 'the original neo - noir of the 90s', 'the best performance of any supporting actor ever', 'a star - making performance']"
"the andromeda strain is the greatest science fiction film ever made
.
i know that is very sweeping statement , so i 'll qualify it by adding that the andromeda strain is one of the few films made that genuinely deserve the label of "" science fiction , "" stories in which speculative science is at the core of the plot .
2001 : a space odyssey is probably a better film , but it really only qualifies as science fiction if you consider metaphysics to be a science .
most all other films we normally classify as science fiction , or sf , are really just fantasy , action or horror stories set in a futuristic setting .
the andromeda strain starts out with two soldiers in a high - tech ( for 1970 ) van looking for a crashed satellite in a tiny new mexico town .
something bad happens to them .
pictures from a reconnaissance plane show a shocking sight .
apparently everyone in the town is dead .
the authorities call a "" wildfire alert , "" summoning four scientists , all but one of them somewhat reluctant , to a super - secret underground germ warfare laboratory in nevada .
two of scientists , stone and hall , fly directly to the town in space suits and find a town where almost every single resident literally dropped in their tracks , their blood turned to powder in their veins .
some went insane before they died and two of them , a baby and an old wino , are miraculously still alive .
they take the survivors and the satellite back to the lab , where stone pressures the white house to call up a "" directive 712 , "" an executive order to cauterize the area around the town with a nuclear bomb .
what they find on the satellite when they get back to the lab is andromeda , an organism that defies all the normal rules of earth - like life and mutates as it grows .
their only hope to cure it is to find out what a perfectly healthy baby boy has in common with an old derelict .
what they find out is that organism feeds directly on energy and that detonating the a - bomb over the town would only spread it across the entire planet .
they barely call off the bombing in time .
but then the organism mutates into something that threatens to eat through the labs defenses and break out .
this triggers the lab 's last - ditch defense mechanism , an atomic bomb .
to those raised on the brainless action fare that pollutes movie theaters these days , the andromeda strain will probably seem interminably slow .
much of the film is a lot of people standing around looking at video screens and computer readouts .
but what the characters see on those screens ratchets up the tension with every turn of the screw .
the performances are universally fine , with the actors keeping things low - key and restrained , just like scientists .
to me , the real appeal of this film is the fact that it shows scientists acting like scientists and
makes it seem exciting .
we follow the logic of their deduction step by methodical step , puzzling like they do every time andromeda behaves in a way we do n't expect .
this film is only available on wide screen on dvd and that is the way to see it .
it was originally rated g when first released but it now carries the pg rating , mostly for very mild nudity and one scene in which a body 's wrist is slashed , spilling its powdered blood .",1,"['the greatest science fiction film ever made', 'makes it seem exciting', 'the performances are universally fine , with the actors keeping things low - key and restrained']"
"the last steve martin film i saw , the spanish prisoner , was a very different approach for the comic actor .
as a millionaire leading a massive conspiracy in order to rob "" a process "" from a clueless businessman , martin 's character did it all for money .
in his most recent movie , bowfinger , martin plays yet another con man except this time he does it to succeed in the film industry .
he wants to direct a successful picture that will force people to remember his name , that will make him more popular at the parties , and , most importantly , that will cause fed ex to deliver important business packages to his front door .
playing the title role , martin is once again the good guy ;
the one we cheer for to complete his low budget action movie .
this con man is very likeable for some reason , even though he is doing the same exact thing as the malicious jimmy del from the spanish prisoner .
maybe the message is that , in hollywood , to win over the trust and friendship of others , you have to be a little evil .
bowfinger is a very clever comedy with great performances from its two stars .
martin , who also wrote the screenplay , is perfect as a jerk with a conscience and eddie murphy does his best "" peter sellers "" in two different , but equally hilarious , roles ; one as a big time move star and the other as his nerdy , burger king employee brother .
the story follows aging and failing director / producer bobby bowfinger as he makes one last attempt to become a respected member of his field by creating a b - action movie called chubby rain .
in order to attract actors and crew members , bowfinger promises them that hot shot actor kit ramsey will star in the movie .
the only problem is that kit refuses to be in it .
but this wo n't stop the aggressive bowfinger .
he is so determined to complete his film that he decides to put kit in it without even telling him .
he has his actors approach kit on the streets of los angeles in character with a hidden camera filming the footage .
will bowfinger be able to make his film ? or will kit ramsey discover what exactly is going on ?
bowfinger is a very cartoon - like movie that pokes fun at hollywood and its famous residents while simultaneously holding a very solid story line .
the only area where the film really lacks is the cameo department .
this is the kind of movie that cameos are all about , it is always funny to see actors / directors / producers making fun of themselves or co - workers especially in a playful movie such as this .
besides the very repetitive and superflous ending , bowfinger is a joy to watch . if you take a movie like this seriously then you will never enjoy it . if you accept the incredulous plot and the extreme caricatures of real entertainment figures , the movie is great fun .",1,"['hilarious', 'the movie is great fun', 'a very clever comedy with great performances', 'a very solid story line', 'a joy to watch', 'perfect']"
"it 's hard not to recommend "" the others .
""
the supernatural thriller , written and directed by alejandro
amen ?
bar ( "" open your eyes "" ) , adroitly establishes and maintains a low - key atmosphere of menace .
the cinematography , by javier aguirresarobe , is as good as i have ever seen and nicole kidman gives another in her growing body of fine performances .
but the pacing of the story moves from deliberate to downright sluggish and the payoff of the tale left me less than satisfied .
overall , the film plays like a very high quality version of any number of old "" twilight zone "" episodes where the characters spend a great deal of time wandering about looking afraid and disoriented , only to learn they are actually a child 's toy , a military test subject or a department store dummy .
watching those vintage shows and listening to the players chatter , i always wanted to shout , "" get on with it ! "" as much as i appreciated the atmosphere and acting in "" the others , "" my reaction was much the same .
set at an island mansion off the coast of england during world war ii , the story focuses on grace ( kidman ) , who tends to her children anne ( alakina mann ) and nicholas ( james bentley ) and worries about her husband , charles ( christopher eccleston ) , a missing serviceman .
anne and nicholas suffer from photosensitivity and grace patrols the estate with the keys to all 50 doors , protecting the little ones from excess light by making sure that only one door is open at a time .
at the beginning of the film , three servants , mrs .
mills ( fionnula flanagan ) , young , mute lydia ( elaine cassidy ) , and mr .
tuttle ( eric sykes ) , an aging gardener , join the family .
the two that speak seem agreeable enough at first , but it soon becomes apparent that they know something that grace does not .
to make matters worse , the children are upset : nicholas is unusually jittery and anne claims to be seeing ghosts .
grace attempts to blame the troubles on the new arrivals to her home , only to realize that whatever is happening is beyond them .
that 's essentially the whole story , with the tension growing until the pivotal moment when everything becomes clear .
earlier , there is an outstanding scene where grace darts outside , only to be enveloped in fold after fold of shimmering fog .
the visuals in the otherworldly sequence , courtesy of aguirresarobe , are simply astounding .
i also enjoyed the presence of religion , a rarity in films dealing with the supernatural .
grace is a christian and answers her children 's questions about life and death with the assurance of a devout worshiper .
when mother is away , though , the kids speculate whether her statements are fact or folklore , just as real children do .
but those nice touches fail to enliven a film that is too slow or make up for a lackluster ending .

"this film is worth seeing for those who want to see what mick jagger looks like when sporting an abe lincoln beard .
the rock and roller is asked to carry the film as the action antihero of australian legend . . .
ned kelly , the so - called robin hood of the aussies .
but he fails to be convincing
, in my opinion he is better suited to play gene kelly than ned kelly .
the film opens to a b / w prologue of ned kelly bravely going to his execution .
then it goes to technicolor and ned is seen in what goes for flashback , coming home from jail after a 3-year sentence to see his mom and reacquaint himself with the large kelly family .
this scene is set in 1871 .
in the background we hear the booming voice of waylon jennings , as he sings shel silverstein 's lyrics , which tells -- of ned 's hatred for the british rule and hope for ireland to be a republic .
ned says a debt must be paid . . . as he hears voices from his dead father , his class - divided country , and his conscience , all telling him to get revenge .
so begins
ned 's romp through australia 's outback , seeking justice for all the wrongs his people have suffered .
he begins by stealing horses , after complaining about the unfair tax law on horses that stray , which favors the rich landowners .
when he 's only 20 he forms a gang , causing him to hide the rest of his life from the police , who put a price on his head of two thousand pounds .
when ned 's mother ( clarissa kaye ) is jailed on a false charge of abetting criminals and sentenced to 3 - 5 years , ned offers to surrender in exchange for his mother 's freedom .
when the authorities refuse , the kelly brothers go on a robbing rampage , burning mortgages of the poor found in postal vaults and murdering some soldiers .
rampaging through the outback , they gather sympathy among the poor and lower classes , who do n't trust the traps ( police ) .
spoiler to follow in the next paragraph .
in the climax , kelly and his gang plan to ambush a train with british police , but someone kelly trusted tips the police on the train and kelly is trapped in a saloon and captured .
ned 's brothers commit suicide rather than be taken alive .
but kelly 's gang escapes , as ned heroically has the police go after only him and his brothers , as they become decoys .
this was a flat presentation , hardly touching an emotional button on what all the fuss was about over ned kelly 's call for justice .
jagger did n't have a prayer in succeeding in this dry script offered by ian jones and tony richardson .
the story failed to focus on australia , seemingly a more british film than australian .
under richardson 's lackluster direction , all jagger seemed to do , was proclaim his innocence and vow revenge , which soon became a shrill cry .
if you want to see a better film about ned kelly , catch "" mad dog morgan "" ( 76 ) , a much truer and more daring version , with dennis hopper giving a much better characterization of ned kelly 's madness , something this film could only do in a ho - hum manner .",0,"['dry script', 'he fails to be convincing', 'this was a flat presentation , hardly touching an emotional button', 'in a ho - hum manner', 'the story failed to focus', 'soon became a shrill cry', 'lackluster direction']"
"what if one of our cities became the target for terror ?
what can we do ?
what can america really do about the increasing threat of terrorism ?
what basic human rights are we willing to sacrifice to prevent another oklahoma city disaster ?
so far america has been the leading nation , opposing the fundamentalist terrorists around the world .
it is the land of opportunities .
it is the land of freedom .
but what if it became the new target ?
this dark fantasy has unfortunately a very strong grounding in reality .
when a special branch of the united states military , under the command of general william devereaux ( bruce willis ) , takes prisoner suspected terrorist mastermind sheik ahmed bin talal , islamic fundamentalists across the world take notice .
the only warning the fbi receives is a single , cryptic message : "" release him .

then all hell breaks loose in new york .
a bus is destroyed , killing 25 civilians .
a broadway theater is bombed .
hostages are taken at a school .
as the wave of terrorist activity crests , the president must consider if the only way to save the city and break the grip of fear is to declare martial law .
devereaux argues against that eventuality , but is nevertheless ready to lead 10 , 000 men into action on american soil .
another person not in favor of martial law is anthony hubbard ( denzel washington ) , the fbi agent in charge of investigating the terrorist activities .
his staff is comprised of smart , energetic , intelligent men and women very much unlike the usual group o !

but the attacks escalate .
the fbi are helpless , chasing an invisible enemy .
the land is under siege .
they have lost control . .
a terror is coming from within . .
what 's great about this film is that it is made as if holding up a mirror to life .
it reflects reality .
and that 's why it makes such an impact
.
edward zwick has created a clever , well written and terrifying thriller that may very well be one of the best films of the season .
the director manages to tell several stories simultaneously .
and so his film plays on several levels , never loosing focus on its main objective .
he is exploring the abuse of power , the distrustful relationships that exist between various segments of the u . s .
government ( the army , the fbi , and the cia ) .
he takes a look at the complexities inherent when so many secrets and lies are involved .
the palestinian community in 1998 new york is treated exactly as japanese americans were during world war ii .
there are concentration camps and unlawful interments , all in the name of the "" greater good .
"" in the latter part of the film the land of opportunities looses its heart and soul -- freedom .
was that what the terror !
ists really wanted ?
this film has evoked protests and objections from the arab - american population in the u . s .
and n .
y .
especially .
but to me these protests seem unnecessary .
zwick is careful to not step over the line and make the palestinians typical hollywood bad guys .
the script is therefore wonderfully balanced . agent hubbard 's best friend and loyal colleague frank haddad ( tony shalhoub ) is lebanese - american .
and it is quite often
you hear lines such as "" my first boyfriend was palestinian .
they seduce you with their suffering "" or "" they love this country as much as we do .
""
but no matter how you twist this matter , you wo n't get away from the fact that when it comes to world wide terrorism
it is arab - speaking population who are in the great majority .
more to the point , the siege demonstrates the injustice of blanket condemnation of any ethnic group by depicting the unfair treatment of all arab - americans by the u . s .
military .
and thus this film does not serve as a source for discrimination in any ! way .
denzel washington is dashing as always .
in this role he is much more determined and stronger than usual .
anette bening is enjoyable and believable
as a shadowy cia operative who prefers espionage , a network of snitches and seduction to gather information . .
bruce willis is terrifying as the sadist , hungry for power , that never looses his connection with the audience , since his point of view is not too hard to understand .
the film is elegantly shaped .
the scenes are easily floating into each other and the film never seems overlong .
zwick knows exactly how to provoke tension , horror and emotions and
does it with a rarely observed professionalism .
he tightens the intensity as the events progress .
and when a plot twist comes , it actually is surprising .
it is not a film drained in patriotism , like the work of roland emerich .
nor is it a film that portrays explosions purely for entertainment values .
it is a daring picture that has courage enough to undertake such a risky story and difficult journey .
it has courage enough to get involved in politics .
it questions our foreign policies , mentality and defense .
i must admit that it ends rather disappointing , as the director turns the patriotism way up and innovation down .
but despite of that , it is certainly an intelligent and thrilling film that provokes emotions and thoughts ;
a virtue that few summer films can boast of .

the blame for a mess this big has to be spread around among the principals .
rebecca gayheart , following roles in "" scream 2 "" and "" urban legend "" , should have known better than to take yet another role in yet another teen body count movie .
pam grier has totally wasted any credibility she might have gotten from her role in quentin tarantino 's "" jackie brown "" . and rose mcgowan should just quit acting .
she has no charisma , no presence , and no acting skills other than rolling her eyes and looking disaffected .
mcgowan manages to be upstaged by her real - life boyfriend , rocker marilyn manson , whose fifteen second role here is far more interesting than anything any of the "" real "" actors are doing .
manson , sans trademark makeup & contact lenses , and with an obviously fake moustache , looks eerily like nicholas cage ; who woulda thunk it ?
that crack about direction by committee was n't merely a pithy sound - bite .
stylistically , thematically & narratively , "" jawbreaker "" is all over the map , varying wildly in tone & content from scene to scene .
though credited solely to writer / director darren stein , one gets the feeling that no two scenes here were actually guided by the same hands .
if stein was indeed responsible for the whole of this atrocity , someone needs to get the man some drugs , pronto .
prozac , lithium , kava , ritalin , something , anything .
he 's quite obviously in desperate need of chemical help .
"" jawbreaker "" is a monumental waste of effort and resources , and quite likely one of the single worst films i 've ever seen . to call "" jawbreaker "" garbage would be to insult garbage .
bad flicks for the rest of the year are safe ; i 've already got my pick for worst film of ' 99 .

"the happy bastard 's quick movie review the concept of enjoying a stupid comedy is best realized as keeping it stupid , really .
shift gears even once and the audience can be thrown miserably out of control .
sadly , that is the case with kingpin , a film directed by the farrelly brothers , the duo that brought us there 's something about mary and dumb and dumber .
since the duo directed and did n't write the script , i can assume that 's part of the problem .
the story seems good enough : a pro bowler in the 1970 's by the name of roy munson ( woody harrelson ) is sitting on top of the world .
his popularity has gone through the roof and he 's getting his career off the ground .
then , however , he runs into ed mccracken ( bill murray ) , a rival bowler with hardly any real consideration for , well , anything .
these two form an ill - timed relationship that involves risky betting , and , before roy sees it coming , ed 's abandoned him
and he 's about to lose his hand in a bowling ball machine .
forward seventeen years later , where roy has become quite the loser , complete with mechanical hand , torn - up car , and , of course , the occasional knocking up of the ugly - ass landlord to avoid paying rent for a while .
however , he finds a glimmer of a hope upon a visit to a local bowling alley , where he runs into an amish kid named ishmael ( randy quaid ) , who has quite the bowling arm .
with the kid 's help , he figures he can be known again , particularly at the biggest bowling tournament rapidly approaching in reno , nevada .
of course , the amish kid needs some coaxing , particularly when you consider , well , he 's amish .
this leads to some of the best comic scenes in the film , such as roy 's process of removing horseshoes or milking the cow .
finally , the duo get on the road and , along the way , pick up an additional helper- a beautiful hustler ( played by the gorgeous vanessa angel ) .
the main problem i had
with kingpin was n't the fact it was n't funny .
in fact , it does have some rather hilarious scenes in it , such as the aformentioned above and roy 's explanation of not having children ( something involving a cheese grater ? ) .
but that 's just it- scenes .
there 's a couple of really serious scenes that throw off the entire momentum of the movie , like the abuse angel takes from her hustler ex - boyfriend .
i mean , was this really necessary ?
could n't have this been handled just a bit wackier ?
i mean , this is a comedy , why throw ethics in ?
particularly in a farrelly brothers vehicle , where hair gel can be easily mistaken ?
that really ruined it , however , and that 's too bad .
the acting is top notch , especially from angel and murray , and the really funny scenes are worth noting .
still , if you 're going to think dumb , think dumb all the way through , ok ? at least the farrelly brothers got back on track with mary or i 'd still be a little bit irked .",0,"['throw off the entire momentum of the movie', 'the main problem i had', 'sadly', ""that really ruined it , however , and that 's too bad""]"
"for timing reasons having to do with baby sitters , we recently went to a multiplex and saw undercover blues .
i would give it one half of a star for guts .
anyone in a movie this bad would have to have guts .
i later read a ny times review that said kathleen turner and dennis quaid had gotten so plump
they looked like they had the mumps in the show .
the script was the worst part .
they had characters who talked with funny accents in an attempt to make you laugh .
they had lots of "" great "" sight gags
like two people trying to go in a door together and therefore bumping shoulders against the door .
turner and quaid both kept smiling like some idiots on a game show .
the good news is that we were smart enough to vote with our feet and left . buy some tickets and give them to your worst enemies .
tell them the show is great and smile a lot .

"of course i knew this going in .
why is it that whenever a tv - star makes a movie it 's always a romantic comedy , and then they say on entertainment tonight or something , that they were "" attracted to the characters .
they were really original .
"" original ? !
let me give you a run - through of picture perfect : character
a ) kate ( jennifer aniston , from tv 's friends ) , a smart , beautiful , professional woman wants two things she ca n't have : a new job - title and the love of her co - worker kevin bacon .
her boss will only give her the job if she gets married and gets a mortgage and gets a lease on a german sportscar , and kevin bacon pnly sleeps with married or involved girls .
what does she do ?
she invents a fiance !
then when everyone wants to meet him , she tells some poor schmoe she met at a wedding that she will pay him $ 1000 to pretend to be in love with her for a company dinner , and pick a fight with her at the end , thus breaking the engagement but still being able to keep her job , since the guy ends up looking like a jerk and she is the poor , defenceless female .
he , of course , goes along with it .
gee , i wonder if they get together in the end .
i 've seen more original stuff on the wb . and better stuff too .
picture perfect also makes the mistake of being _
wayyyyy

"i 've heard it called "" jaws with claws "" and that 's a fair summation of the plot , though that tag line does little to quantify quality .
director stephen hopkins ( blown away , predator 2 ) and screenwriter william goldman ( maverick , misery )
would have you believe that this is an epic historical drama about man against nature , based on what really happened in africa to the railroad workers trying to build a bridge to the 20th century .
they 've stacked the deck with two big stars ( val kilmer , michael douglas ) , a bigger production design , beautiful photography ( by academy award winner vilmos zsigmond ) , and a score
so overblown that it makes the lion king soundtrack sound like chamber music .
the movie does n't make a lick of sense , though , either as an epic or as your basic boo - fest

in fact , some of the bits are
so laughably ludicrous that you may think you 've stumbled into the sequel to mystery science theater 3000 :

"tbwp is probably the single most profitable film ever .
not surprising , considering its tiny us$100 , 000 budget , to date it has earned in excess of us$130 million .
that 's a shocking 100 times profit !
rumours have it that a smart internet ` marketing ' ploy was so successful in gaining cult - like fanatics , by word of mouth coupled with strings of excellent reviews , the film just exploded in the box - office , raking in millions on its opening weekend .
shot in 16 mm and video ( i suspect . )
, the film chronicles the forays of 3 students who go in search for the legendary blair witch .
audiences are put in the first - person perspective in the entire mis - adventure , often wobbly and blurry at times , it takes a bit of getting used to in the beginning .
this is supposed to be the material they discovered in the woods where the 3 disappeared ; edited and put onto the screen for the benefit of our audiences .
tbwp is
simply smart . filmed to look as if it was really a stock - shoot by a bunch of students in search of the blair witch as a school project , one may suspect ( like yours truly ) that its simply a lazy but smart approach to film - making .
simply amazing in that respect , i must say .
talk about impact ,
oh yes , tbwp does have quite a bit , in fact most audience will find it deeply disturbing .
i did , especially the last bit
but i 'm not revealing more .
you have to see it for yourself .
i ca n't help but feel a tad cheated after knowing how commercially successful this film has become .
could it be that finally , an indie - film has unwittingly found a formula for commercial appeal ?
or was it all simply a ploy by the big players right from the beginning ?
well , i guess the fact stays ; tbwp is highly original , clever and will most definitely leave most with something dreadful to talk and think about for weeks prior to watching this film .
no gore , no special effects ,

"i did n't realize how apt the name of this movie was until i called the mpaa ( the motion picture association of america - the folks who decide what 's g , nc 17 , pg , r or x ) to ask why the preview was rated r .
so that we can make some sense of their response , let me tell you about the movie itself .
""
the celluloid closet "" is a documentary about how homosexuality has been portrayed in the movies over the past several decades .
it 's brilliant , funny , naughty and extremely poignant .
it tore at my heart to watch a gifted lesbian screenwriter explain that , as a rule , gay audiences hunger for any hint of homosexuality on screen .
regardless of how veiled - or how sordid - the presence of a gay or lesbian person allows others to lessen their sense of isolation and makes them feel as if they 're not quite so invisible as america seems to want them to be .
the movie itself is rated r - and for good reason .
it contains scenes of bloody , violent gay bashing and graphic , uninhibited , sex .
as with any movie , i appreciate knowing about these things ahead of time , so i can decide for myself whether to see the movie with a friend , a date , my 11 year old niece , alone or not at all .
but , that 's the movie .
now back to the preview .
prior to this film being theatrically released ( it was originally filmed as a documentary for hbo ) i had seen the coming attractions trailer for it at least six times .
there was no nudity , no violence , no bad language , nothing that i could see that would be offensive or inappropriate for a general audience ( okay , whoopi goldberg did refer to someone "" boning "" someone , but
the last i knew that was n't one of the seven words you ca n't say on tv ) . except for a scene of two fully clothed men kissing .
hmmmmm .
when i inquired about the rating on the trailer , a very nice woman at the mpaa quoted from "" the handbook "" that a trailer approved for all audiences could contain "" no homosexuality or lesbianism and no going down on someone .
""
hello ?
i was in the office
and it was the middle of the day .
bravely , i pursued .
""
i 've seen that trailer ,
oh . . .
probably half a dozen times , "" i gulped . . .
""
and i do n't remember that scene .
"" "" well , "" she chirped .
""
it 's there .
our little eyes are trained to see that .
""
no really .
in the words of dave barry , "" i am not making this up .
""
they are "" trained "" to "" see that ? "" when someone who was shocked at the rating the first time and made a note to watch it carefully the following five times or so managed to let it slip past her ?
gosh , i certainly do n't mean to question the mpaa , or "" the handbook "" .
i
would , however , like to suggest that it 's they who are in the closet on this one .
and the light ai n't good in there .
but , having seen "" the celluloid closet , "" and being one of a handful of straight people involved in a primarily gay and lesbian weekly bible study ( email me and i 'll give you the details ) , none of this was any big surprise .
the point of the movie was that homosexuality , even in the politically correct 90s , is ridiculously perceived as a threat to a mostly heterosexual society .
a point well made in this candid and honest film
.
now , i could go off on the mpaa 's ruling that a trailer must contain "" no homosexuality or lesbianism "" and ask how that is defined , particularly in light of some of the things , both sexual and non - sexual , that i 've watched straight people do in trailers .
i just do n't feel the need to go there , because it seems so obvious .
i 'll instead suggest that the mpaa re - evaluated their evaluation criteria .
let the ratings reflect not subject content , like "" sex "" and "" violence "" .
let them reflect attitude content .
in the future , i 'd be interested in knowing whether the movie is rated d for disrespectful or s for stereotyped .
then i 'd truly be able to make an informed decision about how i spent my time .",1,"[""it 's brilliant , funny , naughty and extremely poignant"", 'candid and honest film']"
"as any sociologist will attest , your childhood and the types of parents that you have will heavily influence your happiness as an adult .
parents that are supportive and environments that are nurturing will yield children who will embrace the values and norms that can allow them to live healthy and productive lives .
but if your upbringing is marred with violence , hate and dysfunctionality , then your journey towards a happy adulthood will be saddled with psychological obstacles almost too great to overcome .
` affliction ' explores how a man never truly escapes the grip of an unforgivingly nightmarish childhood .
the man in question is wade whitehouse ( nick nolte ) .
here is a man who is like any other citizen on the surface .
he is a productive member of the community and goes about his daily routine much like you and me .
but as you scratch beneath the surface , something scary and evil begins to rear its ugly head .
we see that he is a mean - tempered person .
he has a hard time taking control of his emotions , which usually gets the better of him .
he is quick to apologize for his actions and wants to be a gentle person , but something is sparking a tendency towards violence .
he also has tremendous problems with relationships .
he is divorced and his only connection to love is his daughter .
but his bearish persona and stature alienates her .
he is visibly shaken by her rejection even though she says that she loves him .
his demeanor also puts his relationship with a local townsgirl ( sissy spacek ) at risk .
she tries to remain true to him and supportive , but for women unlucky enough to attach themselves to this kind of person , relationships will ultimately end like sentences ending with an exclamation point .
finally , he is spiteful and vindictive .
as a rejected father , he initiates a custody battle that seems hopeless .
as the town 's only police officer , he issues a speeding ticket to a man whose father has just died .
we can see that this is a man that is both afflicted and living with pain .
he is a prisoner and a slave to it .
he is moving towards a level of madness and insanity that defies comprehension .
what kind of force can move a man to the edge of his emotions and beyond the reach of people who genuinely care for him ?
we learn that the answer is his father ( james coburn ) .
this is the kind of father that every son would be ashamed to have and that any woman would be afraid to meet .
he is an overbearingly misogynistic and frequent drunk who rules with an iron fist .
we see his tyrannical behavior through flashbacks .
to heighten the father 's churlishness , the flashbacks are shown as home video footage taken by a very frightened person .
very effective .
today , wade 's dad is quite elderly , but still manages to instill fear into a grown man .
the influence that the father possesses is inescapable , and its unsavory effect clamps down hard on the tortured wade .
the result is every son 's nightmare ? becoming like the father that one has always dreaded to be .
this is a terrifically presented piece of psychological drama , and nolte turns in a strong performance as a man whose pain seems to become a detriment as well as a necessity .
he 's a hulking person who is still reduced to whimpers when in the presence of his father .
coburn displays heft
as the bitter dad .
but , it 's most certainly not saturday - night - friendly fare .
there 's nothing light or fluffy about this film .
that may turn many moviegoers away .
but it 's certainly worth noting that this is a well - acted drama showcasing nolte 's and coburn 's raw acting talents .",1,"['very effective', 'a terrifically presented piece', 'displays heft', ""this is a well - acted drama showcasing nolte 's and coburn 's raw acting talents"", 'turns in a strong performance']"
"the dream team is a thoroughly entertaining comedy featuring four loveable characters who just happen to be slightly insane .
billy , played by michael keaton , is an extremely temperamental mental ward patient whose short fuse and violent tantrums tend to get him in trouble .
christopher lloyd portrays henry , an obsessive - compulsive who requires that everything be neat , orderly , on schedule , and by the books .
he thinks he 's a doctor
so he walks around wearing a suit and carrying a clipboard on which he constantly scribbles notes and files reports .
jack , played by peter boyle , thinks he 's jesus .
and finally , there 's stephen furst as albert ,
a chubby catatonic who speaks only in baseball and television phrases .
the dream team follows the misadventures that beset the four - some when their psychiatrist , dr .
weitzman , takes them out of the hospital for a field trip to yankee stadium .
during a pit stop , they get separated from weitzman and are left to fend for themselves in manhattan .
the movie 's charm derives mostly from the camaraderie and chemistry between its delightful cast .
the four leads in the film play off each other quite effectively ; they never miss an opportunity to argue , bicker , or insult one another .
henry and jack , for example , fight over who 's going to get to ride in the front passenger seat on the way to the game .
the actors in the dream team have a lot of fun with their characters and with each other .
michael keaton is
well cast
as billy ; he gives his cynical character considerable complexity .
as the divinely jack , peter boyle succeeds in keeping his one - dimensional character funny and fresh .
although stephen furst 's catatonic character is cliched , the actor makes him sympathetic and endearing .
while keaton , boyle , and furst are good , it 's christopher lloyd who really makes the movie special .
lloyd gives yet another outstanding comic performance .
his body language ( for example , the way he walks ) and his facial expressions are perfectly suited to his compulsive character .
lloyd 's brilliant performance yields a pathetic , moving , and memorable character .
the dream team is a solid comedy with more depth and drama than you might expect from its simple premise .

it 's a love it or hate it film .
i simply hated it .
on its menu for fun , is a violent feast served up as charm and done in a tongue - and - cheek manner .
it 's a serial killer / horror film farce of nonstop over - the - top action and sleaze , involving decapitations , vampires , biker fights , extended gun play , and an array of gore that has to be seen to be believed .
a film that regales in its vulgarity and campiness for blood - and - gore , as
it goes out of its way to gloss over the clich ?
s of the conventional b - films .
it 's geared only for the cult film crowd , and will make its mark there one way or the other .
the plot involves two psychopath brothers , the older professional bank robber and killer seth gecko ( clooney ) and the perverted psychopath killer , richie ( tarantino ) , who kills for pleasure and is also a rapist .
they escape jail and go on a killing spree in wichita and then flee to a liquor store in a small texas border town .
they have just robbed a bank and killed a number of cops , they have also taken a middle - aged bank teller as a hostage .
in the liquor store they kill a texas ranger and the store clerk , and burn down the store .
stopping off in a flop - house motel , richie rapes and slaughters the hostage .
these scenes are all done with an eye for comedy and parody , if that 's possible .
on the tv news , it says they have killed 16 so far and most are texas rangers .
the brothers plan to get to mexico and meet carlos ( cheech ) , who will give them a place of sanctuary for thirty percent of their illegal take .
with road blocks and car searches at the border , the brothers commandeer a motor home of a vacationing family who stopped at their motel so that the father could sleep in a real bed .
there is the father , jacob fuller ( keitel ) , who just resigned as a minister because he lost faith ever since his wife died in a car accident ; his sexy 20-year - old , innocent daughter , kate ( lewis ) ; and , her shy brother scott ( liu ) .
it 's not explained how he happens to be chinese .
the story really becomes bizarre when they get across the border and get ready to meet carlos in a bar / whorehouse for truckers and bikers called the titty twister .
the place is open from dawn to dusk , thus the film 's title .
here 's where rodriguez has a chance to throw convention out the window and have some absurd fun , as the place turns out to be a vampire hangout .
it sells sex to its patrons , and has exotic stripper santanico pandemonium ( hayek ) do her alluring strip before turning into a vampire .
the brothers and their hostages have to fight their way out of the place , as the vampires keep coming and the killings become the film 's staple .
this supposedly clever script did nothing but turn me off , though there were a few funny moments in a film that was dripping with special effects and spent most of its script in finding novel ways to showcase its killings .
i 'll take a pass on this one
, it 's just not my style of a film .

"the tagline for this film is : "" some houses are just born bad "" .
so i did n't expect too much from this .
but i had preserved a little spark of ope as i entered the theatre .
i thought : liam neeson , cathrine zeta jones and jan de bont .
i thought , mabe it will be fun ?
and in fact the beginning was rather intriguing .
but by the end of it i thought :
why liam neeson and cathrine zeta jones , jan de bont ? .
these great actors are basically helpless with this muddled mess that defies any rationality .
here is the story : in the monstrously over - decorated mansion known as hill house , visitors are tricked by an unknown doctor ( liam neeson ) into being guinea pigs in a fright experiment under the guise of an insomnia investigation .
among them is a sophisticated bisexual ( cathrine zeta jones ) , a cynical dope ( owen wilson ) and a gentle and emotional lady ( lily taylor ) .
actually , the doctor is researching the "" primordial fear reaction "" and intends to plant disturbing ideas in his subjects and watch what happens .
but he gets unexpected help from the house itself .
it rumbles , hums and belches forth remarkable sights .
portals become veiny stained - glass eyeballs .
a fireplace guarded by stone lions gapes like a sinister mouth .
filmy cherubic spirits take shape under sheets and billowy curtains .
but the computerized spooketeria rarely feels real , placing an emotional wall between audience and screen .
the second half of the film is basically about the main heroine running back and forth from the sinister lamps and evil furniture .
is that exciting or what ?
the worst thing about it is that it did n't have to be bad .
it 's based on a great book , ` ` the haunting of hill house , '' by shirley jackson .
a 1963 adaptation of the book was scary and intelligent .
it played with the greatest fears of our sub conscience .
"" the blair witch project "" , that cost less than an old car , managed to shock and terrify the audiences from their senses .
and with a $ 70 mill .
budget , de bont and screenwriter david self make hash out of a perfectly lovely piece of terror .
de bont has a style of filmmaking so out of line with the material that it is , in itself , frightening .
he is the master of the extravagant special effect and the big visual adrenaline rush .
but why give him a more serious material ?
in the end "" haunting "" will only haunt its fledgling studio ( dream works skg ) and de bont 's career as a director .
yet it would n't be fair to say that everything is bad .
the effects are truly impressive and the house is wonderfully decorated -- beautiful , mysterious , magical and spooky .
but this is where the good things end .
the music is blaring , the floors moving , the ceiling morphing and the pictures on the walls screaming -- and all of this , every second , every moment of screen time , is absolutely without life .
it 's nothing more than a special effects - extravaganza ; visually impressive , but intellectually hollow thriller that simply does n't engage
.
at first you do not know what 's going on .
is this part of the experiment ?
are these hallucinations ?
projections of the subconscience ?
paranoia ?
but in the end it shows out that this is actually happening .
the house is actually possessed .
it is at that point when all your hopes for a good entertainment disappears out of the window
.
for ever , i sat in anticipation for a decent climax and
that 's what i got ?
i believe hichock once said that "" it 's better to wait for a climax , than to see one "" .
this may be true , and it might actually work , but there is only one problem -- jan de bont is not hichock and the things that he shows are not scary , only stupid .
they are impossible to take seriously .
any paralells that you might have heard before , linking this picture to kubrick 's "" the shining "" , are absolutely baseless .
"" shining "" had class , style , story , acting , but most of all talent and originality .
"" haunting "" has only special effects and art direction to boast of .
and those elements alone are not enough to make it a good film .
casting good actors for small , pale parts only makes things worse .
but i guess that no matter what i or other critics say or write , most of you will see this film anyway , even if the tagline would say : "" some films are just born stupid "" .",0,"['stupid', 'basically helpless with this muddled mess that defies any rationality', 'impossible to take seriously', 'the worst thing about it', 'the computerized spooketeria rarely feels real , placing an emotional wall between audience and screen', 'absolutely without life', 'will only haunt its fledgling studio', 'all your hopes for a good entertainment disappears out of the window', 'has only special effects and art direction to boast of . and those elements alone are not enough to make it a good film . casting good actors for small , pale parts only makes things worse', ""intellectually hollow thriller that simply does n't engage"", 'nothing more than a special effects - extravaganza']"
"one - sided "" doom and gloom "" documentary about the possible annihilation of the human race as foretold by the bible .
orson welles narrates and appears in the film in which he , along with best - selling author hal lindsey , discusses various prophecies from the bible and relates them to recent ( well for 1976 anyway ) events .
the film is dated badly , as many things that are supposed to happen in the "" future "" never do .
for example , the planets of the solar system were supposed to line up in the year 1982 and
cause chaos here on earth .
we 're still here .
the arms race between the soviets and america was supposed to kick - off the apocalypse .
we 're still here .
some of the more ludicrous moments come when it 's alluded to that people like jimmy carter and henry kissinger may actually be the antichrist ( ! ) .
also , there 's ten minutes of stock footage at the end of the film meant to give us an idea of what the battle for armageddon might be like .
if it 's anything like it 's depicted as here
then it 's going to be incredibly boring .
the late great planet earth is available on dvd from vci home video .
it contains the film in standard form ( aspect ratio of 1 . 33 : 1 ) , although some moments of stock footage are letterboxed .
also included are brief bios on orson welles and hal lindsey , as well as a trailer for another recent vci home video release , chariots of the gods .
audio is mono dolby digital , and the video is fair to good for a film like this .
i believe this is the first appearance of this film on any home video format so any condition at all is fine with me .
certainly i never expected a remastered print .
curiously , the menu screens on this dvd look nothing like the menu screens pictured on the back of the case .
but they 're menu screens .

so who really cares ?

"based on the boris karloff 's classic by the same name , the mummy starts off with the high - priest of osiris , imhotep , who murders the pharoah for his mistress and is punished by being mummified in the most horrifying way possible -- bandaged up , having his tongue removed , and being covered in flesh - eating scarab beetles , then entombed . . .
all while still alive .
recap a few thousand years later , where a soldier named rick ( played by brandan fraser ) aids a young historian named evelyn ( played by rachel wiesz ) and her brother , jonathan ( played by john hannah ) in finding the book of amon ra , in the process inadvertently freeing the mummy .
problem is that the mummy wants to revive his mistress , using evelyn as a sacrifice . . . walking in with relatively low expectations , i thought this movie was actually pretty good .
the visuals and cgi are astounding , and obviously not cheaply done at all .
they pack a ton of detail into the images , especially during scenes involving mummies rendered completely by cgi .
the computer special effects makes for some brilliant scenes , such as unnerving moments involving flesh - eating scarab beetles and moments where the mummy goes after the people who freed him ( after all , those who took his artifacts are cursed ) .
unfortunately , the film attempts to be way too much in such a short span of time , becoming a tug of war for control between genres .
on one hand , it is a fast paced action film .
on the other , it 's a frightening horror film .
and on the side , it 's a hilarious comedy .
ideally , for it to be successful , the film would have to focus on one the more action oriented aspect , with one character serving as the comic relief ( that would be johnson ) .
the problem with this film is that it has at least three characters serving as comic relief , with rick occasionally delivering his witty one - liner . if they were trying to make a horror - action - comedy , it would have helped if it were established early on in the film , but unfortunately , with the backstory of imhotep 's entombment , that would be impossible .
and then there 's the slapstick fight scene between a sword - wielding rick and an army of mummies .
while really well done , it had the feel of slapstick comedy .
replace the sword with a chainsaw and you 'd effectively have ash fighting zombies in army of darkness .
while entertaining and funny , it feels really out of place .
but at least it 's a break from the naive heroes
that brendan fraser has been playing a lot of .
on the whole , the movie is pure popcorn fare from beginning to end , entertaining the audience .
but i must end my review with a plea to movie theatre owners . . .
turn the sound down !
while a lot of theatres have good sound systems , my ears were almost ringing as i walked out of the theatre ( the sound is particularly irritating and will make you crap your pants if you 're not careful ) .
when they were showing the trailer for the upcoming schwarzenegger film , "" end of days "" , it was so loud

"the law of crowd pleasing romantic movies states that the two leads must end up together by film 's end .
if you 're not familiar with this law , then maybe you 've seen the trailer for this film which shows that the two leads are together by film 's end .
now if you 're a regular reader of mine , you 've heard me say this countless times : you know how drive me crazy is going to end , but is the journey to get to that ending worth it ?
no , it definitely is not .
melissa joan hart ( from abc 's "" sabrina , the teenage witch "" ) likes a hunky stud on the basketball team .
adrien grenier is her grungy neighbor who 's just broken up with his activist girlfriend .
apparently he wants to make his ex - girlfriend jealous enough to take him back , and she wants someone to take her to the big year end dance .
so the two pretend to date for some reason , but only after hart gives grenier a bath to turn him into a hunky stud .
will grenier like his new popularity and turn on his friends ?
will this crazy scheme work ?
do i care ?
the teen comedy resurgence of late has been surprisingly good in terms of comedy .
what makes movies like ca n't hardly wait and 10 things i hate about you work ( and to a lesser extent , she 's all that and never been kissed ) is because the writers of those films seem to realize that high school is a joke and write their scripts accordingly .
i do n't know what the writer 's intention was with drive me crazy .
there was some smart comedy in those films to make the obvious endings worth getting to .
here there 's nothing . . .
just teens whining
about who 's going to take them to the big dance .
do me a favor kids , go get a job or something . . .
just shut the hell up .
in all honesty , the best part of this film is the end credits .
now normally when i say that it 's followed with the joke "" . . .
because the movie is finally over .
"" in this case though the end credits really are the most entertaining part of the film .
after the obligatory second playing of britney spears ' titular song , there 's a quick commercial jingle for a burger joint the kids in the film hang out in and a brief rendition of the school song for their high school .
nothing great , but more entertaining than anything in the 90 minutes which preceded them .

"200 cigarettes takes place on new year 's eve 1981 .
monica , played by martha plimpton is having a huge new year 's party .
everyone in town is trying to get there , but some are caught up in other things .
this is the basic plot of 200 cigarettes .
as we meet the characters headed towards the party , we are sent into many subplots which are unoriginal , and not interesting at all .
this disappointed me greatly .
the film should have been more about the party than the people trying to get there in my opinion .
lucy , played by courtney love , is with kevin , played by paul rudd .
the two are in a relationship that is more of a friendship , but starts to blossom into something more than that .
this subplot is extremely boring and dull , and i am getting quite sick of plots like that .
janeane garofalo is involved in another subplot , dealing with kevin .
she plays ellie , an ex - girlfriend of kevin 's .
this subplot is completely a waste of garofalo 's talent .
there was no point to it at all , and it was hardly even in the movie .
when lucy runs into a bartender , played by ben affleck , another subplot is formed .
the bartender is invited by lucy to come to monica 's party .
at the bar , he runs into two more girls .
the girls are played by angela featherstone and nicole parker , but unfortunately , due to the terrible acting of both of them , i do n't even remember their characters names .
ben affleck is a good actor , but his character does n't go anywhere so he does n't have much screen time to give a good performance .
featherstone and parker are horrible in their roles , and they are part of the reason
the film is so bad .
christina ricci plays val , and gaby hoffman plays stephie .
the two girls are trying to get to the party but are extremely lost .
they meet some guys and end up going around with them all night .
this subplot was alright , but it was quite annoying with stephie 's accent .
hoffman did an okay job of acting , but ricci did good .
she was underused , considering she is such a wonderful actress .
another subplot in the film is the relationship between cindy , played by goldie hawn 's daughter , and jack , played by jay mohr .
jack is an actor who does n't care about the girls he goes out with , he just likes dates for one night , and the next day he does n't .
kate hudson is a huge klutz .
she gets herself into very funny situations , that are the funniest parts in the entire movie .
they are probably the only funny parts in the entire movie as well .
this subplot could have been used more , mainly due to hudson 's performance .
mohr was n't good , but he was n't bad .
he was just alright , which i did n't find acceptable .
there is not much to say about the performances in the film .
none of the characters are developed or shown enough to really tell if the acting is good or not .
the only performances that i can judge are christina ricci 's as always good performance , kate hudson 's funny role , courtney love 's mediocre performance , and paul rudd 's annoying and overused performance .
i was hoping for a little more out of jaw mohr , ben affleck , casey affleck , gaby hoffman , dave chapelle , and especially out of janeane garofalo .
the two strongest things in the film were the great soundtrack and the original costumes .
martha plimpton and christina ricci had very different and original outfits which made me feel like i was in the year 1981 .
the soundtrack is full of 1980 's tunes , ranging from "" i want candy "" to "" tainted love .
""
the songs in the movie also helped create the feel that you were back in the 1980s .
during the film , i often found myself asking the questions , "" is there a reason to this ?
is there any moral story ?
is there a point ?
are any of the events going on in the film necessary ?
do i care what lucy and kevin are going through ?
"" the movie is extremely boring , and by the time they reached eleven - o - clock , one hour before midnight , i could not wait for the movie to be over .
the plot is okay , but the subplots make it terrible .
maybe if the film was about the party , not about the people at the party , it could have been a lot better .
the bottom line : just like a slasher movie , this ? 80s comedy is just one too many .",0,"[""i did n't find acceptable"", 'the film is so bad', 'this subplot is completely a waste', 'disappointed me', 'horrible', 'i am getting quite sick of plots like that', 'it was quite annoying', 'the movie is extremely boring', 'she was underused', 'unfortunately , due to the terrible acting', 'annoying and overused performance', 'we are sent into many subplots which are unoriginal , and not interesting at all', 'the subplots make it terrible']"
"since 1990 , the dramatic picture has undergone a certain change of style .
now , instead of emphasizing feel - good stories replete with characters of noble virtues , the screenplays and direction point toward human struggle and sorrow .
this realist tendancy can be inspiring at times , as 1993 's schindler 's list shows .
most of today 's mainstream drama , however , creates an overabundance of emoting that can turn off members of the audience .
that 's why pictures like october sky , which are a throwback to the good ol' dramas of yesteryear , are such a welcome relief in contemporary cinema .
the movie is based on the true story of homer hickam ( jake gyllenhaal ) , a teenager in the 1950 's company town of coalwood , west virginia .
it 's a well - known fact that the only boys to make a name for themselves are the ones that get out of the town on football scholarships ; the rest grow up to work in the coal mine .
the mine , which is run by homer 's father ( chris cooper ) , is not the place for homer , however .
after watching the soviet satellite sputnik shoot across the october sky in 1957 , homer feels a connection with the outside world -- as he puts it , "" anyone in the world could look up and see the same thing i did .
"" drafting two of his best friends and the brainiac outcast , homer begins to construct rockets .
with the help of their history teacher , miss riley ( laura dern ) , and several mine workers , the four are soon bound for great things .
october sky is a skillfully crafted film , and most of that credit must go to director joe johnston .
johnston -- whose career in the film industry includes everything from directing well - known titles like jumanji and the rocketeer down to an uncredited role as a death star trooper in star wars -- certainly knows what he 's doing here .
he molds characters which are true to life and also fun to watch into a plot that is straightforward and robust
.
he does not push any barriers , but instead adopts a conservative style of filmmaking which enhances the film 's charm .
his finesse brings out elements which might otherwise be lost -- such as the relationships between homer and various mine workers , or the silent struggle between homer 's mother and father .
the cast is well chosen , although the true bright spots are the supporting roles
.
laura dern ( jurassic park ) lends a strong performance in the role of the history teacher , giving the boys the support and guidance they need .
her role is instantly likeable .
chris cooper ( the horse whisperer ) , as homer 's father , is less likeable -- even downright despicable at times -- but his turn here gives gravity to the movie .
he 's definitely a driving force in homer 's life , and his more humane moments give the piece a certain dynamic that is commendable .
the script is generally cheerful , projecting the boys ' endeavors in a lighthearted manner .
there are moments when it becomes predictable -- such as the train tracks scene -- and there are moments when it sacrifices orginality for the need to come up with an emotional plot twist .
it highlights the essence of youth , however , and for its exceptional job at this it can be forgiven other missteps .
october sky
should be a success with audiences .
although it does n't have the appeal of current teen flicks like varsity blues or she 's all that ,
it certainly holds an undeniable quality that older crowds will lean towards .
it 's a welcome change to the dramatic genre , and one that everyone should see .",1,"['molds characters which are true to life', 'exceptional job', 'lends a strong performance', 'one that everyone should see', 'holds an undeniable quality', 'a welcome change', 'fun to watch', 'a skillfully crafted film', 'should be a success with audiences', 'gives gravity', 'straightforward and robust', ""enhances the film 's charm"", 'finesse', 'the cast is well chosen', 'the true bright spots are the supporting roles', ""certainly knows what he 's doing here""]"
"there 's something about ben stiller that makes him a popular choice among casting directors these days .
stiller currently has three projects in circulation , and what other actor can lay claim to that ?
he 's in
"" there 's something about mary , "" which i * still * have n't seen .
and he 's in the acerbic "" your friends & neighbors , "" playing a talkative , sexually - frustrated drama coach called jerri .
now there 's "" permanent midnight , "" in which stiller plays another jerry , this one a heroin - addicted television writer , last name stahl .
there 's also something about this industry that pushes bankable stars like stiller into doing drug - addiction pictures the minute they 've proved themselves commercially .
ewan mcgregor springs to mind who , after successful turns in "" emma "" and "" brassed off , "" received greater respect and admiration for his mind - blowing realization as renton in danny boyle 's transatlantic junk - fest , "" trainspotting .
""
the philosophy appears to be a simple one : if you want 'em to be taken seriously , make 'em do drugs .
"" permanent midnight "" is based on the true life experiences of jerry stahl , a successful hollywood writer who , in the mid - eighties , had a $ 5 , 000-a - week job churning out plotlines for disposable tv sitcoms and a $ 6 , 000-a - week heroin habit .
a habit , in stahl 's own words , "" the size of utah .
"" as stahl , stiller contributes a commanding performance .
unlike "" trainspotting , "" which was successful in having it both ways by chronicling both the highs and the lows of heroin abuse , "" permanent midnight "" instead focuses on the concept of drug addiction as maintenance .
one of the earliest observations in the film is a casual reference to "" naked lunch "" author william s . burroughs who , when asked why he shoots up first thing in the morning responds , "" so i can shave .
"" stahl rarely appears to be puncturing veins for the thrill of it all in "" permanent midnight "" ; it 's so he can talk to his mother on the phone , show up for work on time , even pay his bills .
while the film itself occasionally wobbles around along with stahl , the writing ( adapted from stahl 's autobiography by director david veloz ) is controlled and pointed .
"" permanent midnight "" shows how stahl moved from new york to l . a . to -- again in the author 's words-- "" escape the drug scene "" (
yeah , right ) ; why he entered into a convenient marriage with a british tv exec ( elizabeth hurley , so impossibly polite you 'd swear her single profanity was dubbed ) ; and that he conceived a child in between his random hirings and firings .
stahl narrates all this in a motel bedroom to a sympathetic lover called kitty ( norristown 's own maria bello ) with whom he spent some rehab time .
janeane garofalo is wasted -- and miscast -- as a heavily - bespectacled hollywood talent agent who fails to get her hooks into the doped - up wordsmith , and that 's stahl himself playing a jaded clinic counselor .
stiller , unshaven ( burroughs take note ) and with lots of mascara around the eyes , has stahl stumble through the film looking like a train wreck but , to his credit , never once pushes his pill - popping , needle - jabbing performance over the top .
the ubiquitous stiller is the reason to see "" permanent midnight "" ; a dark , comic , and strangely absorbing study of assisted living .",1,"['controlled and pointed', 'to his credit', 'strangely absorbing', 'ubiquitous', 'a popular choice', 'contributes a commanding performance']"
"kadosh means sacred in hebrew .
amos gitai 's fictional work , after spending most of his career doing documentaries , is a grim story about a failed hasidic marriage , even though the marriage is a loving one .
the marriage will symbolize the clash of cultures in modern israel between the native israeli 's modern viewpoint toward religion and the political savvy hasidic 's intolerable one , as both groups are vying for control of the secular government .
gitai ( devarim / yom yom ) is a labor party leftist , who believes that if the rigid hasidic ever got control of the government , it would sound the death knell of israel .
the emphasis of the film is on how the ultra - orthodox jews of that sect live by the letter of the torah in everything they do and how they subjugate the women to accept their vision of god 's law from only the male 's view .
that if they ever got control of the country , their intolerant attitude would subjugate the country the same way the women are .
the story takes place in jerusalem 's jewish quarters called mea shearim , where we are taken down sinewy back streets with placards pasted on the walls , and into the crowded apartments and prayer rooms where the protagonists live out their idea of the proper jewish life , which is much different than the way most jews live in israel .
this is a controversial film , in that the women are unhappy and the male attitudes are to such an extreme patriarchal ones , that the film is bound to anger most viewers , no matter their belief .
it is a slow - moving , meticulous film , that grabs hold of you by the collar and never lets go .
the force of what is seen , though filmed in an objective manner , never taking a cheap shot at the hasidim , is nevertheless bound to leave questions about the nature of such a practice of strict observance .
the film is meant to be critical of such a rigid people , as it implies how they kill the spirit of everything they touch and with their extreme phobic attitudes , it makes it impossible for them to unite the country when they ca n't at present live in harmony with their own people , and it would be even more impossible to imagine them living with their arab neighbors in peace .
the film opens as meir rises at dawn and goes through his prayer ritual , where every prayer is made to the virtues of god .
he even thanks god that he did n't make him a woman .
his wife rivka accepts the fate she was born into and looks at him from the next bed where she sleeps separately according to hasidic custom .
she looks at him with glistening eyes , not questioning the laws or rebelling against her secondary role and how her religion keeps her from studying the talmud and having all the modern conveniences of life , and from seeing movies and tv .
meir is a talmudic scholar .
his father ( abu warda ) is a rabbi at the yeshiva .
he has been married for ten years and his wife has not been able to give him a child .
since the hasidim look upon a woman 's role in life being only to conceive children , and cook and clean house for the man , while the man 's role is to spend his time in prayer , therefore there is an insurmountable problem in this otherwise loving marriage .
she receives an anonymous letter that states "" a woman without a child is no better than dead .
""
meir 's response , is that it is written like that in the talmud .
meir 's father tells him that the marriage contract must be broken : "" a man who dies without progeny rips a page from the torah .
""
all the blame is placed on rivka , who is thought of as unpure as the reason for her being barren .
she will go through countless ritual baths to cleanse herself , as her rigid mother ( koenig ) dunks her in the holy water and says a ritual prayer for the 12 times she is dunked as an homage to the 12 tribes of israel .
their religion does n't permit them to be examined extensively by a doctor .
rivka goes on the sly and finds out that it is her husband who is sterile , but she can not tell him that because of their religion .
so when meir 's father chooses a younger woman for his son , she is exiled to live alone in a cold apartment in the same jewish quarters .
rivka 's spirited younger sister malka does not want to get married but wants to live a more liberated life .
she has a long time romantic relationship with a fellow hasidic yaakov .
but , because of the way they were both raised , she is still a virgin .
when yaakov joined the israeli army to fight in lebanon , something his sect is not allowed to do , he is thereby banished from the sect even though he is still a believer .
he now works as a singer in a nightclub .
malka 's mother is worried that her daughter wo n't get married , so she arranges with the rabbi for her to marry yossef ,
someone whom she does n't love .
yossef is a very stern follower of the order , he is also a political activist who drives around the city in a sound - truck with a bull - horn urging jews to stick together and fight their godless enemies .
the two sisters are close and languidly discuss their options , with rivka telling her sister to accept the marriage , it will make her happy ; but , while malka is reluctantly forced into accepting it , she has other plans to ruin this bogus marriage .
the harshest scene in the film is on malka 's wedding night .
yossef prays to god for a child and then robotically gets malka to spread her legs , and without the least bit of affection , only a nervousness shown on his part for the function he supplies , as he goes inside her and rams her hard , thrusting away until the act is completed and then retiring without a word or gesture of love .
the sisters have choices , like everyone else in life does .
but the choices are obliterated by one 's beliefs , circumstances , and inward nature , and how difficult it is to carry out those choices if it goes completely against the way one is brought up .
for the sisters , the choices are life or death ones .
gitai by closing in on the daily rituals , tight living quarters and close - knit community , has shown how difficult these choices are for those who have never seen another world and have been kept in the dark all their life .
the film ends with the forlorn malka walking atop of jerusalem and looking down upon it as an outsider would , and everything seems strange to her , all the things she once thought of as being set in stone are now harsh memories , as she has made her choice , and the price of that choice is very heavy indeed .",1,"['never taking a cheap shot at the hasidim', 'meticulous film , that grabs hold of you by the collar and never lets go']"

judging from the fact that potty - mouth adam sandler is the reigning box - office comedy champion , you realize -- albeit while shaking your head -- that yes , there is an audience for this sort of thing . ladies and gentlemen , i weep for society .
mind you , when executed with style and comic ingenuity , jokes like an alarming bodily fluid mistaken for hair gel ( ` there 's something about mary ' ) and a laxative - induced attack of explosive diarrhea ( ` dumb and dumber ' ) can be extremely funny .
unfortunately , ` ready to rumble ' is not being helmed by the farrelly brothers , nor is it bolstered by a script that accommodates the viewer with anything even remotely clever or inspired .
` ready to rumble ' is built around the dedicated fan - base of professional wrestling . . . . which , in fact , sounded like a fine concept for a goofball comedy .
but director brian robbins and screenwriter steven brill handcuff themselves , and limited to a stampede of asinine , humdrum bathroom humor , basically the only thing they manage is to evoke memories of pauly shore and ` bio dome ' .
gordie boggs ( david arquette ) and sean dawkins ( scott caan ) take pride in being hardcore wcw wrestling fanatics .
by day , they transport raw sewage .
by night ( particularly on ?
nitro ' monday )
, they pay homage to their personal hero and savior - jimmy king ( oliver platt ) , the undisputed leader of the professional wrestling community .
with two tickets to an upcoming nitro performance , gordie and sean are psyched about witnessing the king defend his title first - hand .
but unscrupulous boxing kingpin titus sinclair ( joe pantoliano , sporting long hair and cowboy boots ) has other plans .
sinclair is plotting to have diamond dallas page ( playing himself ) pummel the king into the tarp , thereby dethroning the dignified wrestler and embarrassing him in front of a bewildered auditorium full of fans .
gordie and sean are shocked , rioting madly while arguing ` this is n't even a pay - per view event ! ! '
they take it upon themselves to track the king down and supply the encouragement essential for their fallen idol to make a come - back attempt .
along the way , you can expect a lot of sh-- jokes as well .
you may find something to like in ` ready to rumble ' if a )
you are a rasslin ' aficionado yourself , or
b ) you are a dedicated fan of the lowest of low - brow comedies .
i welcome low - brow humor with open arms
- that is , if its fresh and resourceful .
` rumble ' is nothing but a sloppy , frightfully unfunny swamp land of misbegotten retardation .
the first half - hour is the ultimate test of patience .
luckily , the simple - minded events pick up steam , particularly with the well - choreographed wrestling action .
director robbins showed a knack for capturing the brutality and excitement of football in ` varsity blues ' , and when in the ring , he does professional work .
but the violence is too excessive .
having the fake soap opera of wcw wrestling turn into a bloody skirmish brings back unfortunate memories of owen hart 's tragic accident just last year , especially with one character 's dive during a cage match .
this is not something you want a comedy to be reminiscent of .
outside the wrestling action , the lewd jokes and puerile sight gags bring new meaning to the term ?
scattershot ' , while the dialogue fluctuates in on the vulgarity scale of 1 to 10 , with brill 's extensive vocabulary ranging from ` diddly ' to ` boob ' and so on .
the final tally
: i chuckled a few times , groaned a lot , and indulged in one spirited belly laugh involving martin landau as a geriatric wrestling coach who fights pretty impressively for 105 .
casting - wise , ` ready to rumble ' is an odd duck .
oliver platt as a champion wrestling figure ?
he 's perhaps a bit chunky , but fellow wrestlers acknowledge this in the ring by calling him ` fatty ' , which dampens the blow i suppose .
rose mcgowan is fully disposable as a sultry wcw cheerleader ( ` the nirto - est of the nitro girls , ' proclaims gordie ) , but extra pep is added with appearances by wrestlers goldberg , ` macho man ' randy savage and sting ( among others ) .
wcw fans are sure to appreciate these .

"susan granger 's review of "" mulholland drive "" ( universal focus )
whatever david lynch is selling ,
i 'm not buying .
from the writer / director of "" blue velvet "" and "" twin peaks "" comes another dark , mysterious thriller that opens with an automobile accident on mulholland drive , the serpentine street that twists high in the hollywood hills .
dazed , a beautiful brunette ( laura elena harring ) emerges and stumbles down a hill , slipping unobserved into a ' 30s - style apartment as the tenant leaves for a trip .
the next morning , a dewy blonde ( naomi watts ) from deep river , ontario , arrives in la with dreams of stardom in her suitcase .
her aunt owns the apartment and the two women meet .
the brunette has amnesia so the blonde tries to help her discover her identity along with her latent lesbian lust .
meanwhile , a hotshot director ( justin theroux ) , whose wife is in bed with the poolman , is forced to cast a certain actress in his new film and there 's an assassin ( mark pellegrino ) roaming the city .
the tortuous paths of these various characters - and others named cookie , coco and cowboy - intersect at various points but the plot remains elusive because , midway through the story , lynch has the brunette and blonde play two different women in an alternate reality , leaving a huge wad of cash , a blue metallic key , a paralyzed mogul and a lot of questions that go unanswered

even though the characters know that the benign oil drillers of 1984 will become the ruthless hunter killers of 2029 , humans continue to use the machines .
in the climax of star wars , luke relies on the force alone -- his own spiritual power -- to destroy the death star .
in the terminator , however , sara must use another machine -- a giant hydraulic press -- to vanquish her enemy .
cameron seems to be implying that this reliance on technology is inescapable -- and he 's not happy about it .
unabated technological growth brings about the terminator 's other obsession : the apocalypse .
we have plenty of imagery regarding armageddon : thousands of human skulls line the streets of future la .
children watch the flames in a burning television .
when the terminator arrives in 1984 an almost biblical lightning storm precedes him .
even though the "" future is not set , "" there is no doubt about where the world is headed at the end of the movie : the machines will rise and the humans will have to struggle for their very existence .
all sara can do is await it .
( cameron does n't wimp out like he does in terminator 2 ) the end of the world is the human race 's own fault , too .
after all it is the humans that created in the evil machines in the first place .
back in 1984 , when the cold war was still in full effect , the film must have been seen as a very apt metaphor for nuclear war ( another obsession of cameron 's ) .
these days , one can read a criticism of machine - like behavior in humans .
true , humanizing touches are put into paul winfield 's and lance henriksen 's detective characters , but the terminator is also able to move through the city undetected .
cameron also draw parallels between the mechanical efficiency between the terminator and reese when they first arrive in 1984 la .
from a technical standpoint the terminator is very well done .
arnold schwarzenegger is a perfect antagonist -- unstoppable , merciless , obdurate .
we are not meant to empathize with this ultimate killing machine as we are in some of schwarzenegger 's later works ( eg , commando ) , but fear him .
cameron and hurd 's script basically depicts a one hour and forty - five minute chase , taking a few moments here and there to explain time travel and develop the romantic subplot . while we do see the hackneyed dialogue cameron is now so well known for , there is also considerable suspense especially for the first time viewer who may be unsure of kyle reese 's intentions .
cameron directs the film at a rapid , kinetic pace .
either the camera is moving or something within the frame is moving -- usually both occurs .
the violence is not particularly graphic ( temple of doom 's heart - pull scene outgrosses the terminator 's ) , but it is brutally staged making it that much more effective . for a low budget film , the terminator 's special effects and art direction ( especially in 2029 la ) are remarkably well done .
special mention should be made of the stop motion effects work at the end of the film depicting the terminator endoskeleton .
it is some of the best stop motion i have ever seen .
one thing that does n't hold up after all the years , however , is linda hamilton 's hairdo .",1,"['much more effective', 'considerable suspense', 'some of the best stop motion i have ever seen', 'very well done', 'remarkably well done']"

my name is jack carter , and you do n't want to know me "" says our brooding anti - hero ( sylvester stallone ) .
take his advice !
to know this guy is as rewarding as being thrown over a terrace .
and to watch this film is almost as painful .
"" get carter "" is a gloomy looking , unimaginative film that offers no joy .
jack carter is as tough as tough guys come .
he works out of vegas as a self - described ' financial adjuster ' . explaining his duties , he says , "" people make promises and break them .
i help them remember .
""
he has a chiseled body full of tattoos .
he has the weathered look indicative of a man who has seen his share of hard times .
he speaks in a hushed but menacing tone of voice .
in other words , this is sylvester stallone acting like . . .
sylvester stallone .
and like most of his previous roles , his character is a shallow , one - dimensional thug whose modus operandi is to talk tough , hassle a few hapless people , find out what he needs to know , and then dispense his own kind of justice .
with the charisma of a pit bull , being tough is all that jack carter knows .
yet , even tough guys know when to put family first .
as the story begins , we learn that jack 's little brother has died in a car accident .
the police attribute it to heavy drinking .
however , jack is suspicious , believing that he was ' taken out ' .
he takes a break from his vegas duties and tries to see if he can find the truth .
as he pokes around , he runs into several lowlife characters .
they include a shady business partner , a prostitute , a dweebish millionaire molded after bill gates , and an oily owner of a porn website .
any one of them may know something about his brother 's death .
all of them have the means of carrying out the deed .
but do n't expect an exercise in sleuthing where well - placed clues lead carter to the truth .
he 's all brawn and no brains , so there are no epiphanies during his investigation .
instead , he uses intimidation to muscle his way forward , cycling through this circle of suspects .
flustered with his lack of progress , he cycles through them again and again .
this all gets tiring fairly quickly .
by the time the film launches into its final act , we 're numb from its pedestrian pace .
oddly , as a tough - guy thriller , it starves us for action .
admittedly , there is one nifty chase sequence , but this is related to a tangential and needless plot
( carter 's vegas ties send thugs to retrieve him ) .
the story also fails to generate any kind of emotion .
stallone
has the personality of a slab of stone .
and the look and feel of the film is perpetually downcast .
the weather is constantly overcast or rainy .
meanwhile , most shots take place at night , in dimly lit rooms , or in dark alleys .
it 's just impossible to get stirred about that kind of atmosphere .
as a result , "" get
carter "" amounts to nothing more than a flat thriller , bereft of clever moments and devoid of any excitement .

"confucius once said , "" governing a nation is like cooking a small fish -- do n't overdo it .

his maxim might be easily applied to writing a comedy script , for quantity over quality is one of the worst mistakes an amateur scribe can make .
granted , mike judge , writer - director of the workplace satire office space is n't exactly an amateur ( his most infamous work , the mtv series "" beavis and butt - head "" was pure gold for its network ) .
but unfailingly , judge manages to make some rather inexcusable mistakes in office space by spreading an iffy plot over too much ground .
the iffiness in judge 's plot -- a group of coworkers plan the downfall of their despicable boss -- is not in its appeal .
in fact , based on the popularity of scott adams ' cartoon "" dilbert , "" which will soon have its own television series , a satirical view of the american workplace is a hot item in hollywood .
unfortunately the concept lends itself to skit - length sequences which would be more at home on the set of "" saturday night live "" rather than a full - length feature .
the most convincing evidence of this are the trailers for office space , which feature almost all of the movie 's top content ; this leaves the actual picture appearing very deflated . other evidence of office space 's failure to work are its lack of good jokes .
the comedy is marginally funny at best , but not enough to get a packed house of theater - goers to laugh out loud .
the material in the movie is on - key for an older demographic than judge is used to targeting , and this could partially explain his work here .
however , the movie is loaded with too many misfires -- including the token plot -- to allow for any excuse .
the plot centers around three or four cubicled engineers , headed up by peter gibbons ( ron livingston ) , at a company named initech .
after the movie elaborately establishes the miserable working conditions at initech , the movie introduces us to two consultants ( john c . mcginley and paul willson ) which are in charge of "" downsizing "" the company 's payroll .
when peter and his gang learns of this , as well as the reason behind it -- so their smooth talking boss bill lumbergh ( gary cole ) 's stock will go up -- they set about creating a plan to see his downfall .
the circumstances that follow were obviously intended to be hilarious but they come out as anything

"it is hard to imagine that a movie which includes abortion and incest as prominent plot devices could be so sensitive , so delicate , so insightful and yes , even so enjoyable
.
somehow , the cider house rules manages to keep an even keel in the face of the harsh subject matter and allows a substantial amount of heart to shine through .
set in the 1940 's , the film tells the story of a unique young man named homer wells ( tobey maguire , ride with the devil ) .
an orphan , twice rejected as an infant by possible adoptive parents , he grows up in the care and under the tutelage of dr .
wilbur larch ( michael caine , little voice ) , father figure to the orphans of st .
cloud , obstetrician or abortionist to the unhappily pregnant women who come there seeking his help .
figuring that as long as homer was going to stay at the orphanage , he might as well be of use , dr .
larch begins teaching him all he knows about obstetrics .
soon homer is delivering babies like a professional .
he refuses to perform abortions , instead wondering why the couples just did n't behave more responsibly .
larch , too old and experienced to have such youthful ideals , marvels that homer "" continues to have such high expectations of people .
""
such is the result of an insulated upbringing .
though skilled in certain medical procedures , homer remains woefully naive and ignorant about most everything else .
he finally figures that in order to find his place in the world , he must go out into it .
befriending a young couple who had come to see dr .
larch , he hitches a ride with them and parlays that into landing a job as an apple picker with a group of black migrant workers at the orchard where they lived .
thus , homer begins his worldly instruction , with new friend candy kendall ( charlize theron , the astronaut 's wife ) a willing tutor .
tobey maguire is well cast yet again as an inherently good man who is seeking answers to life 's questions . . .
many of which he was unaware needed to be asked .
he demonstrates a quiet strength and thoughtful curiosity that is both warm and appealing .
michael caine is , in a word , brilliant as the caring caretaker of these orphans , many of whom he helped to bring into the world . calling them "" princes of maine , kings of new england "" in his ritualistic goodnight , mr .
caine manages to communicate the love and commitment larch has towards these children without becoming maudlin or saccharine .
delroy lindo ( a life less ordinary ) has many powerful moments as mr .
rose , the strong and charismatic leader of the apple pickers whom homer joins .
director lasse hallstrom (
what 's eating gilbert grape ? ) and screenwriter / novelist john irving ( the world according to garp ) , who adapted his own work for this movie deserve much of the credit for the balanced approach to the sensitive subject matter .
regardless of one 's personal stand on the divisive matter of abortion , it is hard to imagine anyone becoming offended by the evenhanded treatment used by these filmmakers .
the title is a reference to a list of rules posted in the quarters of the illiterate apple pickers .
figuring the rules did n't apply to them since they did n't have a hand in writing them , they decide to ignore the list and make up their own rules as they go along .
dr .
larch , in his own way , acts similarly .
there is a danger in that line of reasoning .
god has also given us a set of rules .
unlike the list posted in the cider house , god 's rules , if followed , promise us benefits beyond our imagination .
and yet , many continue to ignore his "" rules "" preferring to make up their own as they go through life .

"i feel sorry for the financial backers of "" waterworld , "" which is supposedly the most expensive film ever made ( at $ 172 million ! ) , and is also one of the stupidest - boy did they get ripped off !
in fact , this film is not really a movie , but more of an amusement park ride with a plot .
it 's not even just another case of cliches strung together
( well , it is that too ) , it 's something that 's painful to watch because it relishes in its flaws .
kevin costner stars as a man who is some kind of mutant half man / half fish .
he is an explorer / mariner on an alternate earth that is completely covered by water because the polar ice caps melted .
he 's referred to as the mariner , but they "" the meaner "" would have been a more appropriate title because he 's cold , rigid , and strict -
and he 's supposed the be the good guy !
he docks at a small floating village of sorts .
he trades dirt for money and this introduces us to the other important characters .
first we meet one of the villains , then the soon - to - be heroine , a child prodigy , a wacky inventor , and a group of primitive people that somehow have some of the technology we have today , but also some of the low - tech tools used by pirates and vikings .
immediately the film 's biggest flaw is apparent
: are these people primitive or highly advanced ?
it does n't seem like anyone can read yet
they have ski - doos and airplanes !
how are these things powered ?
and if they have airplanes , could n't they just keep flying until they reached dry land ?
also , if the planet is completely covered in water where did they get the materials to make these things ?
i 'm sorry ,
i 'm all for checking your brain at the door when going to the movies , but elements like these can not go unnoticed because they draw our attention away from the story and confuse us
.
there was potential here for a good pirate story set in medieval times before modern technology , so why mix the two together ?
it does n't make any sense .
there really is n't much of a plot here because the story moves
so quickly it never takes time to explain anything .
the only thing we learn is that the prodigy child , enola ( mojorino ) , has a tattoo on her back that is supposedly a map to "" dryland .
"" who put the tattoo there and how come
it has taken them this long to figure this out ?
we never get an answer , just a stupid action movie about whoever can get the girl will be the victor of sorts if they reach dryland .
to make a long , boring , stupid , and just plain bad story short
; the mariner escapes with a woman named helen ( tripplehorn ) and enola .
they sail for a long time , encountering some strange people in the process and fight off "" the smokers "" as lead by the idiot villain deacon ( hopper ) , who kidnaps enola .
the story becomes a overly grand adventure with the mariner taking on an army of goons , rescuing enola , and bringing them all to salvation ( how original ) .
even with all its special effects , action , and adventure this film is boring
.
not a single character is likable , therefore neither is the plot .
dennis hopper completely rips off jack nicholson 's joker , while costner just plain rips .
still , "" waterworld "" is professionally made with a good production design and an original idea but no substance to it .

m .
, i saw the little mermaid for the first time .
it took me a few years to get over an aversion to this movie that was caused seven years ago , when i stayed with one of my mom 's friends for a couple weeks .
they had a young child who listened to the little mermaid soundtrack constantly and , over that two week period , i heard every song from the movie probably a hundred times .
by the time i got back home , i promised myself i 'd never see the movie .
but promises are made to be broken , especially when you 're looking at a 17-day , limited engagement .
damn those shrewd disney marketers and their mind games .
the little mermaid is based on a hans christian anderson fairy tale , but it 's disney - ized , which means lots of talking animals and bursting into song .
it also means the heroine is a total babe who shows off cleavage from a seashell bra at all times .
i never wanted so much to be a pair of shells . . .
the heroine , of course , is ariel ( voice of jodi benson ) , a 16-year - old mermaid who is going through that rebellious phase .
she skips her concert to explore a wrecked ship and hang out with a seagull that talks like buddy hackett , who tries to orient her to the mysterious world of humans .
she 's also dealing with feelings she has n't had before -- which comes when you get scales in places you did n't use to have them -- about a handsome prince ( no disney movie would be complete without one ) .
her father , king triton of the merpeople , strictly forbids such lusting after the ways of the "" savage "" humans , in a condemnation that reads as a not - so - subtle analogy about old- fashioned parents who forbid interracial dating .
what 's a king to do , though ?
the girl 's in love and
even total destruction of her little shrine to the human world does n't deter her .
ariel saves the prince 's life when a hurricane rises up , and just has to meet him .
she makes a deal with ursula , the sea witch ( voice of pat carroll ) .
you know she 's evil because she has a huge potbelly and one of the worst asses in cartoon history .
she also has octopus tentacles for feet ( something those dr .
scholl 's corn pads will not fix ) and offers to help ariel out .
she 'll make her a human for three days if ariel will give up her pretty voice ; ariel has three days to make that prince kiss her , or else she becomes a slave to the witch forever .
and if she pricks her finger on a sewing machine or eats an evil apple , she 'll fall asleep forever .
it 's a simplistic plot , yes , but the little mermaid was a revolution in the disney world , coming after such lackluster efforts as the black cauldron and oliver and company .
it ranks as one of the best disney cartoons , certainly since the ' 50s .
all the elements are there -- memorable songs like "" under the sea "" and "" kiss the girl , "" cartoon animals like sebastian and flounder , an evil villain who still has characterization and charm , and a fair amount of humor that caters to adults as well as children .

"hong kong cinema has been going through a bad spell .
the last few productions have been effect laded action adventures that combine both the best and worst of american filmmaking with the same qualities of hong kong films .
in a nutshell , the current crop of films from hong kong has been maddeningly convoluted and visually sumptuous .
with the one time british colony reverting back to mainland ownership , a lot of hong kong 's best talents have crossed the pacific to work on u . s . productions .
such talents as jackie chan ( rush hour ) , chow yun - fat ( anna & the king , the corrupter ) and yuen woo - ping ( the matrix ) have all moved into the budget bloated world of hollywood filmmaking with mixed results .
now we can add two other hong kong filmmakers to the mix with star jet li and director and fight choreographer corey yuen kwai .
unfortunately "" romeo must die "" bears all the trademarks of a typical hollywood action film and none of hong kong 's rhythms .
the film opens in a nightclub as an asian couple is necking .
enter a group of chinese gangsters led by kai sing ( russell wong ) .
kai confronts po sing ( jon kit lee ) , the son of kai 's boss and leader of the local chinese family .
a battle breaks out between the bodyguards of the club and kai , who handily kicks and punches his opponents down .
it 's not until club owner silk ( rapper dmx ) , bears down on kai and his henchmen that the fight ends .
the following morning po sing is found dead .
suspicions escalate , as issac o'day ( delroy lindo ) is told of the murder .
his concern that the war between his and the chinese family may explode and ruin his plans to move out of the business of corruption and into a legitimate venture .
issac implores his chief of security , mac ( issiah washington ) to watch after his son and daughter .
the scene shifts to a prison in china , where han sing ( jet li ) learns of his brothers murder .
he fights with the guards and is dragged off to be disciplined .
hung upside down by one foot , han recovers and battle his way out of custody in a blistering display of fight choreography and stunt work .
escaping to the u . s .
han sets out to find the person responsible for his brother 's death .
"" romeo must die "" is in many ways a fun film .
it is both absurd and assured .
the basic plot of a gangster wanting to become legitimate echoes "" the godfather "" .
the relationship between jet li 's han and aaliyah 's trish o'day reminds us of abel ferrera 's "" china girl "" , except that romeo must die
's
couple never once exchange more than a loving glance towards one another .
their romance is much more puritanical than any other romance in film history .
the performances are adequate if not fully acceptable .
li , of course has the showiest part , having to express both an innocents and steadfast determination .
allayah , in her feature film debut manages to carry what little is asked of her with a certain style and grace .
it 's obvious that the camera loves her
and she is very photogenic .
but , still the part is under written in such a way that even a poor performance would not have affected it .
delro lindo as issac o'day carries himself well in the film .
an unsung and under appreciated actor , mr .
lindo turns out the films best performance .
the other performers are all adequate in what the script asks of them except for d .
b .
woodside as issac 's son , colin .
the performance is undirected , with the character changing his tone and demeanor in accordance with whatever location he is in .
an unfocused performance that should have been reigned in and / or better written .
first time director andrzej bartkowiak does a workmanlike job in handling the film .
having a career as one of the industry 's best cinematographers , bartkiwiak knows how to set up his shots , and "" romeo must die "" does look good .
but the pacing of the film is lethargic ,
only coming to a semblance of life during the fight scenes .
the script by eric bernt and john jarrell is not focused in such a way that we can care about the characters or the situations they are in .
the big gambit of buying up waterfront property to facilitate the building of a sports center for a nfl team is needlessly confusing .
and of course the common practice of one character being the comic relief of the film becomes painfully obvious here as anthony anderson as allayah 's bodyguard
, maurice has no comic timing whatsoever .
the best things about the film are its fight scenes .
jet li is a master of these intricate physical battles .
one needs only to see his film "" fist of legend "" to understand that the man is without peer in the realm of martial art combat .
here , jet is given the opportunity to show off in a way that "" lethal weapon 4 "" ( jet 's u . s .
debut )
did n't allow .
unfortunately , a lot of jet 's fights are aided with computer effects that detract from his ability and precision .
also "" romeo must die "" must be noted as having the most singularly useless effect ever committed to film , and that is an x - ray effect that appears three times during the course of the film , showing the effect of bone crushing blows on an opponent .
obviously a homage to the famed x - ray scene from sonny chiba 's "" streetfighter "" ,
the scenes here are just pointless and interfere with the pacing of the film .
it 's as if the film has stopped and a video game has been inserted .
one problem though about the fight scenes .
those that are familiar with hong kong action know that even though the films are fantasies and are as removed from reality as any anime or cartoon .
they do have an internal rhythm to them .
a heartbeat , so to speak in their choreography .
the fight scenes in a hong kong film breath with an emotional resonance .
this is created by the performance , the direction and the editing .
here in "" romeo must die "" , there is no staccato .
every fight scene , even though technically adroit and amazing becomes boring as the editing both cuts away from battle at hand and simple follows a set pattern .
the rhythm is monotonous .
a hong kong film has a tempo that changes , heightening its emotional impact .
' rmd ' is limited to a standard 4/4 tempo , not allowing for any emotional content whatsoever .
a fine example of this difference can be found by examining a couple of jackie chan 's films . .
watch the restaurant fight from the film "" rush hour "" and notice that the context of the fight , while technically amazing is rather flat ( the framing and cut always do not help ) .
now look at the warehouse fight from "" rumble in the bronx "" .
there you have a heartbeat , and emotional draw that does n't let the audience catch its breath .
the stops and pauses for dramatic effect work perfectly , causing the viewer to be both astounded and flabbergasted .
here in ' romeo must die ' , the fight scenes have no more emotional content or character than any john wayne barroom brawl .
jet li is a grand and personable screen presence .
it 's a shame that his full talents were not used to full effect here .
one day filmmakers here in the u . s .
will stop making films by the numbers and start to embrace the style and emotion that has made hong kong action pictures such a commodity .
until then , we 'll be left with emotionally hollow product like "" the replacement killer "" and , currently "" romeo must die "" .",0,"['not focused', 'lethargic', ""it 's a shame"", 'unfocused performance', 'unfortunately', 'the performance is undirected', 'needlessly confusing', 'there is no staccato', 'has no comic timing whatsoever', 'emotionally hollow product', 'the fight scenes have no more emotional content or character', 'unfortunately', 'are just pointless and interfere', 'becomes boring', 'monotonous']"
"adam sandler vehicles are never anything special , but continue to make a load of money .
which really goes to show the sad state of cinema today .
while good comedies like rushmore , to choose a recent example , gets limited release and does n't make a lot of money , big daddy got a huge release and has made a lot of cash .
it 's also nothing special and does n't deserve the money it 's making
.
but i digress .
sandler plays sonny koufax , a unemployed new yorker with a seemingly low mental age .
his girlfriend makes a ultimatum to him : either wise up and get responsible , or she 's leaving him .
by a strange set of events , koufax ends up with julian ( played by twins cole and dylan sprouse ) a five year old kid .
after a failed attempt to impress his girlfriend with the child , koufax decides he wants to keep the child .
however , social worker mr brooks ( mostel ) finds out that koufax is n't the real father and wants to take julian back .
koufax along with his new girlfriend layla ( lauren adams ) fight to keep the child .
big daddy
really is n't that good .
many of the jokes revolve around toilet humour , and supposedly we are meant to find julian and sonny peeing against a wall to be funny
.
there 's the occasional good one liner , but these are usually strangely delivered wrong and lose most of the humour .
the film , after all these silly gags , then suddenly turns sentimental , and this is where big daddy really goes from bad to hideous .
the court scene at the end of the film is useless and unbelievable , and not helped by the soppy overacting .
it 's a poor attempt to win over the audience .
adam sandler basically plays the same role he has in his last few films ( except the wedding singer . )
joey lauren adams is much , much better , and deserves a far better film than this trash .
steve buscemi pops up in a funny cameo , and his scenes are pretty funny .

what can you say about jackie chan that has n't already been said .
since the release of ' rumble in the bronx "" back in 1996 ( the u . s . release ) , jackie has become a fairly recognizable commodity on america 's video shelves .
having made over 80 films , jackie has finally succeeded in bringing his style of action - comedy to the west .
his latest release , "" shanghai noon "" , is a joyful tribute / spoof of the classic western .
and by adding jackie chan into the genre , the tag line for the film ( "" the western gets a kick in the pants "" ) rings true .
jackie stars as chon wang , a lesser imperial guard in the forbidden city of china .
the royal princess pei pei ( lucy liu ) is set to be married to the obnoxious son of a nobleman from another prefecture .
unwilling to follow her father 's wishes , princess pei pei with the assistance of her english tutor , decides to escape to america .
but this is all a ploy devised by exiled guard lo fong , which will lead to the princess ' kidnapping and ransom . unable to take any legal action , the ransom demands are met and three of the forbidden city 's bravest guards ( played by cui ya
hi , rong guang yu , and eric chen )
are ordered to transport the ransom payment to lo fong in carson city , nevada .
chon wang pleads with the imperial court and is given permission to join the team , as he is looked upon as a buffoon .
on a train in the u . s .
jackie meets up with bandit roy o'bannon ( owen wilson ) .
he is much less of a bandit than he is a glory hog , looking simple for the notoriety and fame that being a bandit will bring him .
with his gang in tow , roy attempts to rob the train , when one of his gang murders the chinese interpreter of the royal court , who also happens to be chon wang 's uncle .
chon wang gives chase , foiling the attempted robbery , but also leaving himself stranded in the desert .
as the disgraced guard wanders through the desert , he again comes upon roy , who has been left for dead by his former gang .
buried up to his neck in the desert , roy pleads with chon to dig him out .
chon demands to know where carson city is .
roy directs him , and chon leaves .
but not before sticking two chopsticks into roy 's mouth and telling him to dig himself .
chon soon finds himself confronted by angry crow warriors , a friendly sioux tribe , gunslingers , a horse that thinks and behaves like a dog and an indian bride ( brandon merrill ) , before once again running into roy .
""
shanghai noon "" is just good fun .
the chemistry between the cast is remarkable .
the performances are all acceptable within the whimsical levels of the film .
jackie 's performance is as good as anything he 's done before
.
he 's not called on to do much acting here , as the character is not written with any depth .
but jackie 's natural charisma shines through , and his comic timing is so perfect , both physically and ( surprise ) verbally that once again he commands the screen whenever he is on .
owen wilson , last seen in the embarrassing remake of "" the haunting "" , gives a good natured performance as roy o'bannon .
his innocence is refreshing and fun .
a bad guy that 's not really bad .
his scenes with jackie are some of the best bits of comic dueling since martin and lewis .
lucy liu as princess pei pei is given little to do in the script , but for a change does not play a nymphet or some other deviant .
the character is a noble woman of status and wealth , but finds a greater cause as a result of her own imprisonment .
the rest of the performances are all broadly drawn comic performances .
nothing here is realistic , mind you .
""
shanghai noon "" is first and foremost a light , jovial film .
and the performances match that style with ease .
the cinematography by dan mindel is gorgeous .
using calgary , alberta as the prime location .
mr .
mindel is able to create a lush , romantic western feel to the film .
nothing here really looks like nevada , but the locations are so beautifully shot and staged , the film can be looked upon as a loving tribute to earlier films of the genre .
and as such , the script by alfred gough and miles millar plays fast and loose with history , but with reverence to past films .
homage to such films as "" high noon "" ( obviously ) , "" red river "" and most notably "" butch cassidy & the sundance kid "" all bring a sense of nostalgia to the film .
it is a comforting experience .
at a time when the western is considered either old hat or irrelevant , here is a film that embraces those old attitudes and
( dare i say ) clich ?
s and manages to make them palatable and refreshing .
here is a film that is not contemptuous of the genre .
this is the purest "" horse opera "" since the days of george o'brian or john wayne .
director tom dey has crafted a loving tribute to hollywood 's past .
in this , his first film mr .
dey shows both a love of character and of craftsmanship that is refreshing to see .
nothing here really stands out , or takes one 's attention away from the story or action .
and that is as it should be , when jackie chan is your star .
and what of the action and stunts .
well , while not up to a level of "" drunken master 2 "" or any of jackie 's hong kong films , "" shanghai noon "" is miles ahead
of anything jackie has done in an american film before .
his timing , choreography , and creativity are still as sharp as ever .
jackie even gets to recreate a few scenes from his earlier films ( obvious to those of us that have seen those films , but refreshingly fun for those unfamiliar ) .
finally jackie can honestly say , that he has made an u . s . , his way and incorporating his style .
to sum up , "" shanghai noon "" is a fun summer confection .
not too heavy and not too light .
a fun and entertaining film that the whole family can enjoy ( parents be advised there are scenes of smoking , drunkenness and peyote use ) .
an enjoyable and charming film that can and will be enjoyed again and again .",1,"['so beautifully shot and staged', 'an enjoyable and charming film that can and will be enjoyed again and again', 'the chemistry between the cast is remarkable', 'just good fun', 'some of the best bits of comic dueling', 'a loving tribute', ""as good as anything he 's done before"", 'gorgeous', 'a comforting experience', 'a fun and entertaining film', 'miles ahead', 'refreshing to see', 'a fun summer confection', 'natural charisma shines through , and his comic timing is so perfect', 'gives a good natured performance', 'refreshing and fun', 'sharp as ever']"
"play it to the bone ,
the newest addition to ron shelton 's sports - themed repertoire fails in numerous ways .
like most of shelton 's other great films ( bull durham , white men ca n't jump )
, this dud unsuccessfully attempts to use athleticism as a method of connecting characters and creating interesting subplots .
shelton 's films are not considered sports films , but they do heavily revolve around a specific game to tell a story .
shelton has been so good in the past at using sports to analyze the structure of society that from his collection of films we are given an examination of different classes and races living in various different regions .
play it to the bone is unsuccessful because not only is the boxing theme dull , but the side story of the two guys and a girl travelling across the country is even worse .
the film has no social message like its predecessors .
the relationship between the friends , two failed boxers who must face off against each other in the ring for 50 thousand dollars , is very confusing for a number of reasons .
the whole film , since it is primarily a "" buddy picture , "" depends on the strength of the friendship the two characters have for each other .
unfortunately , it is a very weak bond for the reasons listed below .
1 )
we never see how cesar ( antonio banderas ) and vince ( woody harrelson ) meet .
the two are so different from each other , that a scene of how this odd friendship developed should have been mandatory .
2 ) vince and cesar argue every moment possible on their trip to las vegas .
there is not one convincing moment dedicated to seeing the characters laugh together or actually agree on something .
3 )
the third character on the trip , grace ( lolita davidovich ) stands in the way .
she is in nearly every scene with them , making it impossible to understand the difficulty the two male characters are going to have when they fight each other .
4 ) there are two many interfering , irrelevant side stories .
vince is convinced that he sees jesus on a regular basis , cesar yells at the sky in spanish when he is angry , and grace tries to sell her inventions to hotel owner robert wagner .
these boring tales only hurt
the central plot .
5 ) when it comes to time for the two men to fight , they do n't even hesitate to pound each other .
was n't the whole point of the road trip to show that these two are friends who could never hurt each other ?
by the time the road trip part of the movie is over with , the film wants to be over .
shelton , on the other hand , continues to tell his story .
forty five painful minutes remain .
the boxing scene between cesar and vince starts out very powerful and interestingly different from other boxing movies .
however , the fight goes on for way too long and becomes very repetitive and predictable after awhile , kind of like the whole film .",0,"['very repetitive and predictable', 'fails in numerous ways', 'has no social message', 'there is not one convincing moment', 'forty five painful minutes remain', 'unsuccessfully attempts', 'goes on for way too long', 'these boring tales only hurt', 'is even worse', 'there are two many interfering , irrelevant side stories']"
"in tim burton 's ` sleepy hollow ' , there is a mysterious headless horseman who decapitates residents of the small town of the same name .
he rides a beautiful black steed and carries an imposing sword that cauterizes the wound of his victims with an immediate swipe .
burton 's update on washington irving 's classic tale of ` the legend of sleepy hollow ' offers us the mystery of the horseman , when the screenplay should have merely settled on the aspect of the horror .
writer andrew kevin walker ( ` seven ' )
throws in perhaps too healthy a dosage of sherlock holmes , but the visual treatment of the film is absolutely entrancing , as burton offers foggy locales and detailed costumes that are gorgeous and stirring to examine
.
as ` sleepy hollow ' opens , we 're greeted with a juicy cameo from martin landau , who won an oscar in burton 's ` ed wood ' .
landau plays a prominent citizen of sleepy hollow , who , on a fateful carriage ride through the forest , is decapitated by an unseen horseback rider .
after two more murders haunt the residents of the quaint little town , constable ichabod crane ( johnny depp ) is sent in to investigate .
landlord baltus von tassel ( michael gambon ) explains to crane that the heads have been severed from the carcass and mysteriously taken in each separate case , and that they believe the murderer is a dead hessian trooper ( played briefly by a wonderfully jarring christopher walken ) who has risen from the grave after being decapitated in the western woods .
crane is not a man of great superstition , and is determined to root out the human culprit with his assortment of gizmos and gadgets ( things i was not surprised to find in a tim burton movie ) .
first and foremost , ` sleepy hollow ' is a fun horror film .
as with virtually all burton movies , we are treated to a wonderful score by composer danny elfman , who has once again poured excitement and imagination into an atmospheric soundtrack that accentuates the gothic mood perfectly .
the horseman f / x are stylish and impressive , particularly in perfectly blended battle sequences involving actual actors .
but why did i enjoy ` sleepy hollow ' as much as i did ?
although enjoyable , it was not the numerous beheadings and the plentiful gore that spurted
left and right . .
it was the light comic touch that burton applied .
the film has the sweetness of a candy apple , usually channeled through depp 's wonderful performance as the lovable geek ichabod crane , who is no longer a mild - mannered school teacher but still attains his cowardly qualities .
this is certainly not the only alteration that 's been made .
as the film progresses , it becomes apparent that walker is more concerned with the mystery of the murders than the murders themselves .
the momentum is slowed considerably once crane begins piecing the mystery together , because for the audience , it 's not an issue we particularly wish to be solved .
it 's more effective for the headless horseman to be an elusive demon than an elusive demon with an ulterior motive .
still , we are still captivated by the breathtaking technical detail and burton 's keen eye to capture our attention .
the costuming is exceptional , and the dialogue is crisp and effective throughout
( it 's recognizable that the script was refined by award - winning playwright tom stoppard ) .
the supporting cast exhibits more color and playfulness than many . a blonde christina ricci is in fine form as von tassel 's daughter katrina , and an unlikely romance between she and ichabod is surprisingly consistent .
walken , michael gough ( who appeared in burton 's ` batman ' films ) and miranda richardson are all enjoyable in tackling their separate roles .
i suppose the strengths behind ` sleepy hollow ' lie within the central trio : director burton , constable depp and the headless horseman who hunts him down with ruthless accuracy .
all of this is not to be taken seriously , of course .
` sleepy hollow ' is a lavish , frightening and altogether amusing reworking of a classic tale that many people cherished as children .
if you 've got a decent head on your shoulders , you 'll have the good sense to gallop off to the theater and enjoy it one last time .",1,"['the good sense to gallop off to the theater and enjoy it one last time', 'the supporting cast exhibits more color and playfulness than many', 'wonderful performance', 'surprisingly consistent', 'lavish , frightening and altogether amusing reworking of a classic tale', 'a fun horror film', 'the light comic touch that burton applied', 'refined by award - winning playwright', 'once again poured excitement and imagination into an atmospheric soundtrack that accentuates the gothic mood perfectly . the horseman f / x are stylish and impressive , particularly in perfectly blended battle sequences involving actual actors', 'we are treated to a wonderful score', 'gorgeous and stirring to examine', 'the costuming is exceptional , and the dialogue is crisp and effective throughout', 'are all enjoyable in tackling their separate roles', 'the visual treatment of the film is absolutely entrancing', 'in fine form']"
"i 'm not sure if silvio horta wrote urban legend before or after the success of scream , but i 'm guessing after just because it seems he may not have had time to write a second draft .
seriously , this idea -- a psycho bumping off people in the style of urban legends -- is a great one and i wish it could have been pulled off .
the first sign of trouble comes with the painfully insipid dialogue .
an example : "" that [ car crash ] must 've been awful . . .
for everyone involved .
""
you can tell that the writer intended that something a little more airy was supposed to have been said , just no one figured out what .
i know in slasher movies there is n't supposed to be a lot of great characterization
and i myself do n't mind
cardboard cutouts , but please do n't let the cutouts be so damn bland .
one reason movies like scream , star wars and diva have become so treasured is because they feature charismatic actors playing interesting characters .
aside from jared leto and joshua jackson ( who are n't on the screen long enough )
no one in urban legend makes the grade .
alicia witt shows none of the acerbity or wit
she displayed on cybill , rebecca gayheart
actually looks unattractive ( not to mention as dumb as a post through 3/4 of the film ) and robert englund
just cruises on auto pilot .
good thing brad dourif is here , but wait .
. .
he 's only in the movie for five minutes
_
and _ he 's just redoing his good - natured stuttering character from one flew over the cuckoo 's nest .
which brings me to another aspect of urban legend
: it 's unoriginality .
the film most blatantly ripped off is scream ( another reason that makes me think silvio horta wrote this after craven 's and williamson 's great success ) .
urban legend tries to deconstruct modern - day folklore much the same way scream deconstructed slasher films , but it does n't quite succeed
.
it 's best stab at self - reflexivity is poking fun at "" that girl in the noxzeema ad "" ( ie , rebecca gayheart ) we also have another killer - taunting - his - victim - on - the - phone routine in urban legend and quick , what movie is this exchange of dialogue from : female protagonist : why ?
villain :
why ? why ? ! ?
congratulations to those of you who answered scream and/or urban legend .
like i said , this movie could 've been great .
if only silvio had worked or been allowed to work a little longer on the script .
still , at least urban legend had some pretty cool death scenes and a somewhat realized whodunit angle which makes this slasher is waaaayyyyyy better than i know what you did last summer .",0,"[""it does n't quite succeed"", 'no one in urban legend makes the grade', 'most blatantly ripped off', 'the first sign of trouble comes with the painfully insipid dialogue', 'actually looks unattractive', ""cardboard cutouts , but please do n't let the cutouts be so damn bland"", 'unoriginality', 'just cruises on auto pilot', 'shows none of the acerbity or wit']"
"( dreamworks skg ) running time : 2 hours starring robert duvall , tea leoni and elijah wood directed by mimi leder the first of the two asteroid movies coming out this year ( the second is the macho armageddon ) is actually a dull affair .
elijah wood plays leo biederman , who during astronomy class discovers that a large asteroid is heading for earth .
tea leoni plays a ( rather crap ) news reporter , jenny lerner , who soon discovers about this asteroid through a very long winded and boring way , and robert duvall plays the leader of a space crew , spurgeon tanner , who are planning to blow the asteroid out of the path of earth .
also featuring is morgan freeman as the president , and maximilian schell and vanessa redgrave as jenny 's father and mother . while many people will walk into the film expecting a big special effects fest with the asteroid blowing everything up ( as the trailers seem to promise ) , the film is actually more of a character study , if a very poor one .
the main problem is that there are too many characters in the film , and not enough time to explore them all .
only the space crew are given any depth , jenny lerner , leo and the president are surprisingly 2d , and we never get to know these characters .
and because i could n't care for them , i did n't really give a crap if the asteroid killed them or not .
the script by bruce joel rubin and michael tolkin is horribly simple , and never really makes any interesting statements .
mimi leder , the former er director and director of the average the peacemaker ( 1996 ) , again directs in a ho - hum style , and never really gets any emotion out of a scene , which is a shame .
the cast are seemingly on autopilot , although tea leoni does gives a rather good performance , even if she acts a bit too dorky for her own good .
she seems uncommonly stupid for a journalist .
robert duvall is on autopilot with a underwritten role , he just seems to be in this film for the money .
elijah wood , one of the best child actors working today , is surprisingly average , although his choice of roles lately have n't exactly been brilliant ( i .
e .
flipper , 1996 ) .
his role is also vastly underwritten .
morgan freeman , again , is utterly wasted with a ridiculously underwritten role .
like duvall , he just seems to be in the film for the money .
the supporting cast are all o .
k , none making much of an impression .
ok , so deep impact may have messed up character wise , but surely the special effects are good ?
well , yes and no .
although the special effects should be impressive , with a massive tidal wave destroying new york , the special effects look like , well , special effects .
sadly , the waves looks like it 's been drawn on computer , and does n't look too good at all . surprising really , when the effects are done by industrial light & magic , who did the effects for the lost world and twister .
in the end , deep impact is a wasted opportunity .
what could of been a moving movie with good effects turns out to be a dud in both characters and effects .
the 2 hours the film had could have been used to much greater effect .
once again , dreamworks has churned out another average movie .
let 's hope armageddon is a bit better .

"late in down to you , the lead female character ( julia stiles ) states her greatest fear is having an "" artificial conversation "" with her boyfriend ( freddie prinze jr . ) .
the irony of this statement will not be lost on audience members who have not yet walked out , fallen asleep , or otherwise given up on this pathetic attempt at romantic comedy .
the film is a multi - million dollar testament to everything artificial .
filled with characters , motivation , plot and dialogue that ring fake and shallow at every step
this is an unquestionable disaster .
prinze plays a college student intent on playing the field until he falls for stiles ' freshman co - ed .
at first the movie seems to be an attempt to string along scenes with the sole purpose of out - doing the previous in how "" cute "" it can be .
the happy couple "" psychoanalyze "" each other ; they pick out a song because , as prinze 's dj mother ( lucie arnez ) explains , every couple needs a song ; he smells her shampoo ; she scratches his chest in the morning to let him know she wants to make love .
then , in standard romantic comedy style , things fall apart .
why ?
well , because they have to .
otherwise the couple ca n't make up and live ( presumably ) happily ever after .
down to you exists outside the realm of normal logic .
scenes do not connect to each other and it often seems to be attempting some sort of surrealism , but this is handled so poorly that everything comes off random and stupid instead .
a picnic scene involving the six key characters is just bizarre , not only for the stretched logic of these people hanging out together , or even knowing each other , but mostly because an unusual amount of screen time is dedicated to a goat .
the supporting characters are remarkably flat , and insultingly ridiculous as well .
stiles ' best friend ( rosario dawson ) is a pot head , prinze 's roommate ( shawn hatosy ) is a girl crazy fool who ca n't meet women , and then there are the porn stars ( zak orth and selma blair ) .
he is one of those famous porn stars who is frequently interviewed on television , does the college lecture circuit , and stars in high budget costume epic porns that are shot on film .
you know , the average porn star .
the costume epic idea gives him a reason to appear in a different ridiculous outfit everytime he 's on screen , the porn angle exists just so there can be a couple of stupid sex jokes .
she is a porn star mostly
so we know
she 's slutty , so
her very existence will make stiles jealous and prinze tempted .
attempts at drama ( which means julia is going to cry ) include a pregnancy scare and the big break up .
these characters are so insipid only the most forgiving viewer would be manipulated by these weak scenes .
what happened here ?
the cast is full of likable , promising , young actors ( stiles especially seems to be going places ) .
writer / director kris isacsson has simply given them material so weak not even seasoned pros could pull it off .
in fact the whole film feels like a reworking of last year 's extremely unpleasant the story of us , for teen audiences .
the direction is film - school - grad obvious .
it 's stylish in a hugely self conscious way which throws in split screen , a pointless parody of "" cops , "" characters walking into the flashbacks of other characters , and a hilariously cheesy airport meeting between prinze and stiles where all the extras move in fast motion while the couple moves in extreme slow motion .
plus , the whole story is told flashback style , narrated by prinze and stiles directly addressing the camera .
this is the second film in a row ( following wing commander ) starring freddie prinze jr . which should have premiered on the aisles of the local blockbuster but was likely saved from that fate due to the fluke success of she 's all that .
if he does n't start making better choices fast his future films wo n't be so lucky .",0,"['has simply given them material so weak not even seasoned pros could pull it off', 'insultingly ridiculous', 'these characters are so insipid', 'pathetic attempt', 'ring fake and shallow at every step', 'a couple of stupid sex jokes', 'this is handled so poorly that everything comes off random and stupid instead', 'scenes do not connect to each other', 'the supporting characters are remarkably flat', 'a hilariously cheesy', 'an unquestionable disaster']"
"do you want to know the truth about cats and dogs ?
do you ?
well , as this movie shows us , they make good companions but pale in comparison to the joy and fulfillment romantic relationships can bring .
unfortunately , there 's a giant roadblock set up in our culture that only certain people can get through while the rest of us mill around outside , feeling sorry for ourselves .
a checkpoint beautiful kind of thing , and janeane garafolo 's character abby relates to it well .
like a certain oversized teenage movie critic , she is intelligent and has a great sense of humor but strikes out with the opposite sex because she sees herself as physically unattractive , and the men seem to be backing her up on that .
meanwhile , her gorgeous neighbor nora ( uma thurman . . .
uma being the only woman 's name worse than nora ) attracts men like flies .
as abby tells her , "" you burp and they think it 's cute .
you barf and they line up to hold your hair back .
""
but nora 's down on herself for being too shallow and superficial .
we all have our prwhen a man calls in to veterinarian abby 's talk radio show wanting to know how to get the roller skates off his basset hound .
( oh come on , any idiot knows how to handle that problem ! )
he likes her personality and professional demeanor and asks to meet her in person .
abby , though , knows her body does n't match her personality and that she probably wo n't have a chance with him once he sees her .
so she gives him nora 's body description and stands him up .
nora happens to be in the studio the next day when the dog man comes by and abby asks her for a big favor .
she goes along with the masquerade and the three of them head out for a night of fun , abby assuming the role of a goat cheese farmer named donna .
the dog man finds out even though this girl is beautiful , she 's not quite as intellectual or confident about herself in person , but he does n't suspect anything , realizing he 's not living in a "" three 's company "" episode .
the charade continues , with abby furthering the relationship over the phone ( including a decidedly unnecessary phone sex / masturbation sequence ) and nora furthering it in person , while eventually finding herself attracted to the dog man .
like sleepless in seattle , this comedy / romance is predictable all the way through , but we care enough about the characters that we root them on and will the romance to blossom .
the truth about cats and dogs is n't quite as entertaining as i was expecting it to be , but it handles well a theme
i could identify with .
the thing is , i find janeane garafolo rather attractive .
she 's no uma
but i 'm sure in real life
she 'd have no problems attracting men .
i , on the other hand , could n't attract a man to save my life . . . and am rather proud of that fact .",1,"['it handles well a theme', 'we care enough about the characters that we root them on and will the romance to blossom']"

have gary sinise show up and force the two of them to participate in a poorly planned casino heist .
the villains ' big idea ?
kidnap affleck because he used to be a security guard at the casino , force him to tell you where all the doors in the place are , then dress up in santa suits , create some "" diversions "" and rob the place .
on paper , it seems like the stuff of a potential caper comedy , but veteran director john frankenheimer wrongly picks up that piece of paper and thinks he 's looking at the makings for some sort of clever action - crime thriller .
it 's not like the man is n't capable . . .
far from it .
he 's the man responsible for classic political thrillers like the manchurian candidate and seven days in may .
he wowed me with some the most memorable car chases i 've ever seen in last year 's ronin .
but he 's certainly guilty of churning out some certifiable losers . . .
put reindeer games on the shelf of shame with his 1996 version of the island of dr .
moreau .
step one in making your movie as easily forgotten as possible : cast ben affleck in the role of the world 's most generic hero .
he gets no good one - liners , he does n't get to shoot or implode anything in new and interesting ways , and all we know about him is that he regrets his past as a car thief and wants a cup of hot chocolate and piece of pecan pie .
his name is rudy ( short for rudolph , in all likelihood .
see , it 's called reindeer games .
get it ?
get it ?
shut up . )
in the past , affleck has been at his best as a supporting actor , and reindeer games does nothing to further his viability as a leading man .
step two in making your movie as easily forgotten as possible : gary sinise 's villain dresses and looks like the most standard movie crook a filmmaker could have some up with .
he 's dirty and potty - mouthed
, he 's got long , scruffy hair and a goatee , and i fully expected him to walk out of the casino carrying sacks with giant dollar signs on them .
he 's also extremely inept
at what he does .
he thinks garish cowboy costumes and santa suits make acceptable disguises , and he trusts affleck 's character to pull through even after , time and time and time again , he tricks him and lies to him and nearly kills him .
but instead of tapping into the comic possibilities of this role , sinise seems to think he 's playing some sort of tough , smart , and smooth criminal mastermind , rather than the complete moron that was obviously written into the script .
[ on a side note , gary sinise wins this week 's "" title !
"" award , as he 's the one who gets to awkwardly cram the name of the movie into one of his lines early in the proceedings .
last week 's winner was natasha henstridge for the whole nine yards . ]
how to take your bad idea and make things worse : include two or three plot twists that , instead of making the apparently stupidity of the plan seem suddenly intelligent , make the plan seem even more ridiculous and unlikely .
this is a bad movie .

"i 've never been a huge fan of jeff bridges , but i loved him in the big lebowski .
the part of jeff "" the dude "" lebowski was reportedly written specifically with bridges in mind , and the fit is perfect .
the dude is an unemployed denizen of los angeles , a hippie slob on a bowling team with a soft spot for white russians .
he 's enjoying a leisurely soak in the tub when two thugs break into his apartment demanding to be paid for the money his wife owes .
after much pleading he convinces them they have the wrong guy , but not before they urinate on his rug .
the dude assumes that these "" collection agents "" were after another jeff lebowski , a famous millionaire who also lives in l .
a .
so he goes to meet his namesake to ask for enough money to replace his rug .
the millionaire refuses , but calls him back when he discovers his wife has been kidnaped .
he wants the dude to act as go - between for the kidnapers .
dude and his friend walter ( john goodman ) take on the task , and get caught in an intricate web of kidnapers , millionaires , high schoolers , nihilists , artists , pornographers , thugs , and league bowlers .
comedy is perhaps the most subjective of genres , so take my recommendation as you will : for me , the big lebowski is very funny .
it is an incredibly successful comedy , the ratio of laughs to intended jokes much higher than in most films .
not only are the two leads ( bridges and goodman ) funny separately and together , but each supporting character is a refreshing comic figure .
all the characters end up as the butt of jokes , but the jokes are always deserved and never contrived .
each person may be a comic caricature , but there is always a respectful self - acceptance that lets us laugh at these people without condescension .
the characters are firmly established , and they never change their behavior for a quick , cheap laugh .
it 's not what they do
that 's funny
, it 's who they are , which is why the acting is so important , and so successful , in this movie .
worth mentioning are john turturro as jesus ( that 's jee - zus , not hay - soos ) , the greaser bowler who 's in a lusty marriage with the game ; julianne moore as the post - post - feminist artist whose work has been described as "" vaginal ; "" steve buscemi as the eager tagalong bowler who is constantly rebuked and ignored by teammates dude and walter ; and sam elliott as the rambling , long - winded narrator . aside from the performances , what makes all the characters funny and interesting is the astute dialogue .
people lose trains of thought , they interrupt , they boast , they repeat themselves , they repeat their friends .
. .
they sound natural .
taken with fargo , the coen brothers ' last film , it is evidence that the brothers are observant listeners and gifted writers .
ethan coen is not just good at directing actors , he 's also good at technical directing .
he and cinematographr roger deakins created a beautiful world on film .
perhaps "" beautiful "" is the wrong word ; nihilists , carpet - pissers and thugs are not objects of beauty .
but the bowling photography and a series of viking / bowling fantasy dream sequences are lovingly photographed , as though the dude himself were in charge of immortalizing them on film .
all around , the big lebowski is great , solid comedy .
outstanding acting , writing , direction and photography all combine to make this a great comic success .",1,"['outstanding acting , writing , direction and photography all combine to make this a great comic success', 'i loved him', 'each supporting character is a refreshing comic figure', 'the fit is perfect', 'is great , solid comedy', 'the characters are firmly established', 'an incredibly successful comedy', 'the big lebowski is very funny', 'the acting is so important , and so successful']"
"alchemy is steeped in shades of blue .
kieslowski 's blue , that is .
with its examination of death , isolation , character restoration , and recovery from loss , suzanne myers ' new independent film echoes the polish director 's internationally - acclaimed 1993 release .
language aside , the principal difference between the films is that , while kieslowski took great pains to draw us into the main character 's world , alchemy keeps its viewers at arm 's length .
as a result , while we 're able to appreciate the film 's intellectual tapestry , it is emotionally distant .
alchemy is divided into three chapters : "" charity "" , "" faith "" , and "" hope "" .
while there are common themes and story elements running through all three , the single constant is the main character , a sculptor / russian translator named louisa ( rya kihlstedt ) .
when the film opens , she 's living with her painter boyfriend , whom she believes to be cheating on her .
following his sudden death in an automobile accident , louisa 's life is thrown into turmoil .
events swirls around her , and she ca n't find a source of stability .
in her quest to make sense out of her loss , she befriends her late boyfriend 's mistress , visits her ill sister , and , eventually , abandons her old life by joining a "" back - to- nature "" cult .
alchemy successfully explores a variety of compelling issues .
in addition to asking the basic question of how a person should cope with the unexpected death of a loved one , it probes beneath the surface of concepts like the importance of faith in the healing process , the meaning of love , and the nature of art .
does personality restoration come through interacting with others or escaping from the familiar ?
are artistic epiphanies the result of focused solitude or of living life , with all of its various distractions , to the fullest ?
myers ' challenge is to make these subjects , art film staples , engrossing in a new context .
through louisa 's struggles , she succeeds .
while alchemy is n't always emotionally appealing , it never loses its fascination .
even when we 're not connecting with louisa , who is often more of a locus for ideas than a fully - developed personality , there 's enough material on - screen to hold our attention .
the cinematography is stunning .
city scenes are tinted with blue , adding a cold , bleak dimension to the film 's early portions .
later , when louisa reaches the "" wilderness "" , we 're treated to a dazzling array of autumnal splendor -- brightly - colored leaves in the trees and on the ground .
it 's a startling - but - effective visual contrast that emphasizes the changes taking place in louisa 's life as she travels the road back to emotional stability .
the title refers to the practice of a group of mystical faith- healers who use "" alchemy "" to provide for the needs of the body and soul .
and , although louisa partakes of their peculiar brand of medicine , it 's ultimately love and companionship , not alchemy , that brings solace .
her pain is assuaged only when she lets go of the belief that the inherent safety of being alone is life 's ultimate goal .
even though louisa 's final transformation lacks the impact it could have possessed
had she been a more vital character , it 's still an intriguing and enlightening process to watch
.
alchemy is n't pure magic , but , especially during its best moments , it 's close .",1,"['the cinematography is stunning', 'an intriguing and enlightening process to watch', 'successfully explores a variety of compelling issues']"
"first impressions : critically , a close - to - awful film , but money - wise , it has been doing ( and will continue to do ) great .
a sometimes - funny film that sags and lags and oftentimes gets boring .
an orginal plot that grows old real fast .
one of the only 90 minute films that i 've gotten bored through .
men in black has defied the odds .
when i first saw that the flick was 89 minutes long , i thought maybe that this was a poor attempt at an independence day type film that just ran out of gas .
however , i now realize that not only did men in black run out of gas , but the film in 90 minutes manages to show off a very original idea ( which summer audiences have embraced ) that becomes old about 25 minutes into the movie .
tommy lee jones and will smith play two "" government "" agents who are responsible for keeping order in alien society .
the ridiculous plot begins when an alien "" bug "" , played weirdly by vincent d'onofrio , who was so great in full metal jacket , lands on earth to retrieve a galaxy that 's somewhere on "" orion 's belt .
""
anyway , the basic plot revolves around jones and smith to stop this bug from getting the galaxy , or a higher power will blow up the earth .
the premise is ridulous , but that is not why i did n't like this film .
i love original plots .
this one had an original one .
but director barry sonnenfeld did something to this film that ruined its plot : he made the film drag and also put in unncessary elements in it that are found in romance films .
whenever i saw d'onofrio 's bug stomp and eat people in the film ,
it got terribly boring after a while .
while smith 's wise - cracks did fill in the gaps , it was n't enough .
and also , i can not believe the screenwriters elected to have a sub - plot where tommy lee jones missed his former lover because as an alien agent , they ca n't have contact with any humans really .
and here i see jones , at a satellite computer , watching his lover plant the garden ?
a sentimental moment in an alien movie ?
nice try , but i do n't think so .
it does n't work here .
it just makes the movie even more ridiculous and even more boring
: we do n't only have aliens to worry about , but now we have jones 's conscience .
i came into the movie not wanting to see jones 's conscience , but wanting to see a real action movie that had lots of aliens in it .
maybe it 's unfair that i partly judged this movie on what my expectations were .
nevertheless , even though some parts are indeed funny , the plot in this movie grew old and boring -- quick .",0,"['a close - to - awful film ,', ""i 've gotten bored through"", 'becomes old', 'ridiculous plot', 'grows old real fast', ""it does n't work here"", 'even more ridiculous and even more boring', 'oftentimes gets boring', 'the premise is ridulous', 'run out of gas', 'the plot in this movie grew old and boring -- quick .', 'he made the film drag and also put in unncessary elements', 'it got terribly boring']"
"preposterous religious action film ( produced by the trinity broadcasting network ) about a code hidden within the text of the bible that when deciphered will lead to the end of the world ( nice of those bible authors to put a doomsday code into the most read book ever eh ? ) .
michael york plays a millionaire diplomat who breaks the code and sets out to become god on earth and fulfill the doomsday prophecies , while casper van dien ( terribly miscast and giving an awful performance as a result ) plays the atheist motivational speaker who must stop him .
michael ironside ( great as always , despite the silly film surrounding him ) plays a fallen priest and right hand man to michael york 's character .
here 's some subtle character development you may have missed pertaining to ironside 's character .
now despite the fact that we see him murder a man in the opening scene , the filmmakers are n't quite sure if their audience will understand that he is evil .
how do they fix that ? make specific efforts to show that his character is the only one in the film who smokes !
there are lots of ominous shots of michael ironside smoking . . .
oooooo scary .
but even that was n't enough for the filmmakers apparently , as they later have to infer that ironside 's character is gay !
it comes out of nowhere and just makes no sense .
my main problem with this film is that , despite the silly story ( which could have been pulled off . . . anything can be made believable if executed correctly ) , the events of the film are n't shown with any sense of urgency or importance .
for example , at one point york 's character is declared chancellor of the world or something , and we see one brief , cheesy news report about it .
the movie keeps telling us that the apocalypse is coming , but it never seems that way .
there 's no "" world reaction "" to anything .
the omega code is available on dvd from goodtimes home video .
it contains the film in the original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 . 85 : 1 , and includes the original theatrical trailer , a documentary on the making of the film , production notes , and cast and crew information .
the documentary runs about 25 minutes and is actually surprisingly good
( it looks as though it was made for broadcast on tbn ) , and it does a comprehensive job of interviewing practically everyone in the cast and crew ( with the exception of michael ironside , unfortunately ) .
the best thing about it is that whenever crew members are interviewed , they do an excellent job of explaining their profession and exactly what it is they do on a movie set .
most documentaries tend to overlook this .
doomsday expert hal lindsey is even interviewed ( you 'll remember his documentary from the 1970 's called the late great planet earth , where lindsey speculated that jimmy carter might actually be the antichrist ) .
however , at the very beginning of the documentary the producers of the film managed to get on my bad side .
when interviewed they actually have the nerve to say "" ever see raiders of the lost ark ?
well , our film is like that !

"look back at all the times in your life when there was a fork in the path to the future .
some sort of decision had to be made , and , for better or worse , it irrevocably altered the course of your existence .
> from time - to - time , everyone thinks about the roads not taken , and how things might have turned out if the choice had been different .
perhaps even more dizzying to contemplate is how a seemingly minor action -- catching the 10 am train , for example -- could have an equally profound , yet less obvious , impact .
maybe that 's where you met your significant other , and , had you reached the platform just a few seconds later ?
film makers are no less fascinated by issues of destiny than anyone else , and that 's why there 's no shortage of movies about this subject .
the best of the bunch were probably made by the late polish director krzysztof kieslowski , who was obsessed with questions of fate and chance .
these themes weave their way through many of his movies , including decalogue , the double life of veronique , and the triptych of blue , white , and red .
however , they are most explicitly examined in a 1981 film called blind chance , where kieslowski presents the three different fates of one man after a minor action ( missing or catching a train )
changes the course of his life .
in his autobiography , kieslowski on kieslowski , the director describes his attraction to the concept this way : "" [ the idea is ] rich and interesting ?
that every day we 're faced with a choice which could end our entire life yet of which we 're completely unaware .
""
while this approach has been the fodder for several notable dramatic films ( including , in a way , frank capra 's it 's a wonderful life ) , sliding doors is the first romantic comedy to plumb its depths .
the "" road not taken "" approach is n't just a plot device , either .
writer / director peter howitt expands upon both possible fates of a character after she just misses / catches a train .
the audience watches , with ever - growing fascination , how this one event impacts upon every aspect of her life : her future career , where she lives , whom she loves , and whether she has a family .
as her separate destinies diverge and then re - converge , she becomes two completely different individuals .
that woman is helen , played by gwyneth paltrow as a long , dark- haired brit .
one day , after losing her job as an advertising executive , she decides to return home in the middle of the day .
the scene of the pivotal moment is a train platform .
in scenario # 1
, she just slips through the sliding doors before the train pulls out of the station .
on board , she meets the cheerful , talkative james ( john hannah ) , a monty python fan who is taken with her beauty .
minutes later , in her flat , she walks in on her lover , gerry ( john lynch ) , in bed with another woman ( jeanne tripplehorn ) .
in scenario # 2
, she misses the train and , shortly thereafter , is the victim of an attempted mugging .
she does n't meet james and fails to make it home in time to discover gerry 's infidelity .
juxtaposed one against the other , while sharing many places , cues , and characters , the two stories proceed in parallel from there .
on one level , for viewers who enjoy pondering the workings of fate , sliding doors can be viewed as a deep and wonderful experience .
but , for those who just appreciate a romantic comedy characterized by solid acting , a script with a few twists , and a great deal of genuinely funny material , sliding doors still fits the bill .
one of its most obvious strengths is that it can satisfy many different types of audiences -- those who demand something substantial from their motion pictures , and those who could care less .
it should n't come as any surprise that the acting , at least from three of the four leads , is solid .
paltrow , who does double duty as two helens who are initially the same , yet gradually become much different , is the standout .
she plays both of her roles effectively and believably -- the shy , insecure woman who stays with gerry and the liberated , platinum - blond who severs the ties to her old life and embarks on a new career with a new man .
john hannah , known to most american viewers as the younger gay character in four weddings and a funeral , is instantly likable .
john lynch , taking a break from movies about ireland 's troubles , does a good job presenting gerry as a inept , selfish philanderer .
only jeanne tripplehorn , who plays an over - the - top vixen , seems out of place .
her attempts at broad comedy are occasionally jarring , and it 's occasionally difficult to see her lydia as anything more than a plot element .
one member of the supporting cast deserves special notice .
douglas mcferran , who plays gerry 's best friend , russell , is an absolute delight , stealing every scene that he 's in .
part of this is surely because he is given the best lines in the movie .
on one occasion , he has a marvelous monologue bemoaning how advances in the telecommunications industry have trapped men into a life of monogamy .
on another occasion , while laughing at gerry 's plight with the women in his life , he comments , "" being with you makes the wait for the next episode of seinfeld more bearable .
""
but it 's not all in the dialogue .
mcferran tears into this part with relish ; his performance becomes one of the most memorable aspects of a top - notch comedy .
this is the first feature film for peter howitt , and he approaches the task with unimpeachable aplomb .
the script is shrewd and inventive , combining wit , romance , and intelligent melodrama into a crowd - pleasing whole .
sliding doors grants more than just a good time at the movies , however .
for those who are so inclined , its central theme offers an opportunity to ponder some of the more philosophical questions about the workings of the universe -- all while having a good time .",1,"['plays both of her roles effectively and believably', 'solid', 'his performance becomes one of the most memorable aspects of a top - notch comedy', 'instantly likable', 'with ever - growing fascination', 'the script is shrewd and inventive , combining wit , romance , and intelligent melodrama into a crowd - pleasing whole', 'one of its most obvious strengths', 'an absolute delight', 'a deep and wonderful experience']"
"there have been merchant - ivory costume dramas with more of a pulse than "" the mod squad ,
"" a self - consciously "" hip "" cinematic rendering of the old tv series still looked upon fondly by so many baby - boomers .
well , said "" squad "" certainly wo n't be a pleasant viewing experience for them or anybody else , maybe even the teen target audience the movie has been geared towards .
a contemporary take on this decidedly ' 70s show does n't exactly seem unwarranted , but one wonders if the mold it accumulated while waiting on the shelf did n't transform into a full - blown case of botulism .
how curious that the film begins by defining both mod and squad , insisting that the latter is a group of people working together and then contradicting this definition by keeping its titular trio apart for a sizeable chunk of the running time .
they are julie , pete and linc , reformed delinquents working undercover for the lapd ( exposition put out of the way so fast that you 're likely to be lost from the opening moments on ) , and they are respectively played by claire danes , giovanni ribisi and omar epps , talented actors each deserving of better than this .
their plight involves standard cop - corruption stuff , as our would - be protagonists catch wind of an internal cover - up after their superior ( reliable dennis farina , one of the best things here and gone so quickly ) gets killed and framed for drug trafficking .
they pout a lot and eventually get cracking to expose this convoluted conspiracy using surveillance tactics that would impress the hardy boys and linda tripp but few others .
when you 're supposed to be asking , "" what 's going to happen next ? "" , you 'll instead entertain thoughts like "" who are these people and why should i care ?
"" or "" are n't thrillers supposed to contain thrills ?
"" not that danes , epps and ribisi do n't give it a shot .
danes can do the troubled teen thing in her sleep , as evidenced by "" my so - called life , "" but she 's saddled with a mysterious - boyfriend ( josh brolin )

ditto for ribisi 's ( "" saving private ryan "" )
looney loose cannon , though at least he performs with a wild - and - crazy vigor that occasionally demands attention .
but epps - poor epps .
epps ( "" higher learning "" ) is so short - changed he 's reduced to literally waiting around for a bad guy to chase him .
all this sloppiness can be attributed to the screenwriters , one of whom , scott silver , is also the director .

"with more and more television shows having gay characters , and even the infamous "" ellen "" sitcom being centered on the life of a lesbian , the movie industry too seems to be gaining more and more homosexual based plot lines .
the birdcage was critically acclaimed , as was this years chasing amy .
then along came in & out , and all three of these films are on my top ten list for the years in which they were released .
it 's also noticeable that this "" alternative lifestyle "" becomes less and less taboo as the years go by , and it seems that using comedy as a medium is proving a worthwhile effort .
while it 's a very serious issue to many , it is the comedies that people are flocking to see and that are gaining notoriety .
but the way we 're using comedy to present homosexuality is also changing quite dramatically .
while the gay community was once very stereotyped and used to laugh * at * , it is more and more becoming something we laugh * with * , and when a movie like in & out comes along , it is something that both heterosexuals and homosexuals should be able to thoroughly enjoy .
it does n't poke fun at the lifestyle , it simply uses it to all
it 's comedic capacity , just as love , sex , marriage , birth , death , and anything else has been .
the idea for in & out was born the day tom hanks won his oscar for portraying an aids - afflicted gay man in philadelphia .
if you remember , during his acceptance speech , hanks gave a highly emotional tribute to the gay community , and even sighted a former gay teacher of his as a major inspiration in his life .
it 's a serious and touchy subject , but producer scott rudin viewed it as the setting for a potentially hilarious comedy , and pitched it to screenwriter paul rudnick .
it 's true that if this same film had been written by a heterosexual , it may have been more controversial , but because it was written by an openly gay writer , the prerogative was set .
kevin kline , who only seems to become more and more acclaimed , stars as howard brackett , a high school english teacher in the small , picturesque town of greenleaf , indiana .
after a three - year engagement to fellow teacher emily montgomery ( joan cusack ) , a wedding date has been set , and the hubbub surrounding it is almost as big as that
surrounding another huge story - greenleaf high graduate cameron drake ( matt dillon ) is up for a best actor oscar .
the small town eagerly awaits both events , and both seem quite astronomical , but little does anyone know how much one will affect the other .
when cameron drake is announced the winner , the excitement is heightened as he pays tribute to his high school english teacher , mr .
brackett .
everyone is cheering back in greenleaf - that is until cameron tacks on those three calamitous words , "" and he 's gay .
""
the town becomes silent as the entire population joins in a simultaneous jaw drop .
the thing is , nobody , including howard , can understand how cameron came to that conclusion , and such wild and unexpected news can only wreak havoc in such a conservative american haven such as greenleaf .
naturally the questions pour from howard 's fiancee , parents ( debbie reynolds & wilford brimley ) , students , and the high school 's principal , tom halliwell ( bob newhart ) , and the evidence starts to become more and more obvious : howard is clean , neat , honest , sincere , a romantic , and perhaps the most incriminating fact , he loves barbara streisand .
the frenzy is n't helped any when camera crews from every conceivable news magazine and "" entertainment tonight "" wannabe show up at greenleaf high the very next morning .
one particular reporter is peter malloy ( tom selleck ) of "" inside entertainment "" , who unlike the collage of other reporters , wants to spend a whole week in the life of howard brackett , including coverage of his wedding .
the intrusion is all but welcome by howard , who is going more and more out of his mind with each passing minute .
it seems that no matter where he turns , a camera is being shoved in his face and questions regarding homosexuality are being tossed to him like frisbees .
the dominoes begin to tumble as howard 's closest friends begin acting different and principal halliwell hints at a possible termination of employment should howard indeed be gay .
it all sounds very devastating , and it would be if it were n't presented with near - perfection by one of this year 's most delightful ensemble casts
.
kline seems only to improve with age , and he is downright perfect here .
the great thing about this film is that every single character has a moment to shine , and they use it wonderfully .
every single actor turns in one of their best performances ever .
dillon has never been so likeable , cusack
has never seemed so perfect for a role , and brimley , reynolds , and newhart
all provide huge laughs when they 're up to bat .
rudnick 's script is heavily laced with wit and humor , and you 'll likely find yourself laughing out loud for a solid ninety minutes .
while in & out does n't carry enough to give it four stars , it remains one of the best done films of the year , all - around .
the script is exuberant , the actors are absolutely top- notch , and we 're allowed just the perfect blend of heart - tugging so as not to bog down the laughs .
it remains a solid comedy throughout its entirety , yet we 're still allowed a sappily touching ending .
despite it 's subject matter , and one scene that comes almost too close for comfort on explaining gay sex , this is a movie that everyone could , and should , enjoy .

"there is a scene early in jakob the liar that hints at how much better it could have been .
the scene is set in a jewish ghetto in poland circa 1944 , where a one - time cafe proprietor named jakob heym is walking resolutely through the streets , fists stuffed into coat pockets .
to one side of him , residents scavenge for food in the street ; to the other side , german troops beat a group of jews .
jakob , however , never stops moving .
it 's an efficient , effective set - up for the character , who is clearly nobody 's idea of a hero at the outset .
he is a man who has responded to the horror of his surroundings by withdrawing from them , excising his moral peripheral vision .
the set - up is critical because fate will turn jakob into a reluctant savior .
after a visit to a german commandant 's office and a moment alone with a turned - on radio , jakob learns that russian troops are quite near .
when he brings this first news of the war in years to his fellow jews , they become convinced that he must have a radio , which is a punishable offense in the ghetto .
the good news brings hope to the ghetto ; the everyday specter of suicide vanishes .
a private man of limited creativity finds himself burdened with creating stories of russian military progress just to keep his neighbors alive .
this promising story of an ordinary person doing the extraordinary is burdened from the outset by casting : the "" ordinary person "" in question , jakob heym , is played by robin williams .
i am of the depressing opinion that williams is growing less assured as an actor in his "" serious "" roles with every passing year . compare his dramatic scenes in the world according to garp and moscow on the hudson with what dreams may come or patch adams , and see how much more mannered he has become ( or , at the very least , how much less sensible at choosing material ) .
jakob the liar depends on the notion that jakob has to struggle to craft his fictions , but williams always looks like he 's struggling _ not _ to craft them .
when he improvises a radio address by winston churchill for ailing 10-year - old orphan lina ( hannah taylor gordon ) , he seems relieved that he can finally get wacky .
oh yes ,
and then there 's that little girl .
some viewers will undoubtedly consider the hero 's fanciful stories for a young charge too reminiscent of life is beautiful , but those scenes are n't problematic because they 're familiar .
they 're problematic because they 're jarring and distracting , introducing a cutesy relationship into a film that should n't have been about cutesy relationships .
jakob 's character arc may be about his willingness to act for the benefit of others , but there are plenty of others without poor little lina .
every scene with her feels contrived , pulling jakob the liar away from its central story of hope coming to a previously hopeless people .
it is a pleasant surprise to find that jakob the liar is a much grittier production than you might expect from a hollywood - ized holocaust , combining the weighty subject matter with dark humor in some effective ways .
director peter kassovitz , working from jurek becker 's novel , crafts some nice scenes between jakob and the other townspeople , and draws solid performances from armin mueller - stahl ( as a once - revered doctor ) and bob balaban ( as a barber drifting into depression ) .
there are just too many things going on that prove distracting , whether it 's the sketchy romanctic angle involving liev schreiber as an earnest former prizefighter , or williams ' incongrous presence , or a sweet but utterly irrelevant little girl .
jakob the liar deals with too delicate a subject for such fumbling , and has too compelling a central character to waste .

"the title is taken from the writings of ralph waldo emerson describing the life of a traveler as ' anywhere but here . ' there is n't one thing about this mother - daughter relationship melodrama that felt honest .
it relies on a contrived minor character to tell both mother and daughter
what was obvious to do in order to straighten out their dysfunctional lives , as for some reason they could n't figure it out for themselves .
if the film looks familiar , that is because "" the slums of beverly hills ( 98 ) "" went over the same ground but was fortunate to be more comical and perceptive due to alan arkin and natasha lyonne performances , in which they were fortunate to have a much sharper script to work with .
alvin sargent 's script was weak and annoyingly claustral
.
wayne wang 's ( "" the joy luck club "" ) inept direction made a weak script even weaker by his inability to tell the story unfolding without the voiceover relating what the action could n't convey .
pushy mother adele august ( susan sarandon )
forces her 14-year - old daughter ann ( natalie portman ) to leave a small midwestern burg to go cross - country with her to beverly hills .
the daughter resents her twice divorced , unstable but exotic , schoolteacher mother , bullying her to be an actress as a means of escaping a humdrum life .
the daqughter does n't even like the used gold mercedes mother buys to drive to lala land in and ca n't stand the beach boys records mom enjoys hearing on the car radio .
so it becomes a question of who knows best , as the ladies fight it out between them , until the predictable sweet ending comes in this yawner .
adele 's dream of greener pastures in beverly hills soon does n't look that good , as she lands a job in a slum school , has her precious car scratched by the unruly kids , and settles into a job she hates in order to financially survive .
daughter pines for small town wisconsin and her friends there .
during one of many arguments with her free - spirited mom , they go for ice cream and while mother is being ticketed , she runs away , only to be chased down by friendly traffic cop ( michael milhoan ) , who offers her wise counsel .
with the cop 's zen wisdom passed onto the daughter , she will survive living in many different addresses in beverly hills until she reaches 17 and then she plans to get way from mom by using her good grades to go to brown university instead of ucla . during their stay in beverly hills , she grows from feeling awkward in beverly hills high to immediately having many high school girlfriends and even a high school rich boy admirer-- a t .

eliot ( corbin allred ) reader .
but the transition of her life into beverly hills had no feel of reality , as everything seemed staged and unemotional

when she learns her cousin benny ( shawn hatosy ) , who happens to be her best friend dies in a traffic accident back in wisconsin , she returns for the funeral and in those reunion scenes it was n't clearly shown why she wants to stay there , and for that matter , it was never made clear why the mother wants to leave so badly .
the film is one big battle of wills between mother and daughter over their dreams .
i guess what the filmmaker is trying to say , is that mom is a bad dreamer and the daughter is the observant one , able to recognize mother 's faults when not in growing pains and in need of parenting herself .
mother has a series of setbacks , like being dumped by her dream - boat dentist ( bochner )
she met on the beach , and witnessing her daughter mimic her whiny optimistic sayings when trying out for an acting part .
but mother learns that her daughter has grown - up and is independent and that she has to stop living her life through her .
she learns this when the same wise cop who told ann what to do , is about to ticket her and this time will remind the mother of the right thing to do .
this of course results in the corny ending , showing that mom 's heart was always in the right place , only she went about it in the wrong way .

"` we run tings .
tings do n't run we . '
-sound advice from capone ( paul campbell ) to his squaddie ( or partner ) , floyd ( winston bell ) .
jamaican film , shot entirely on video , featuring a standard cop movie plot mixed with a dash of john woo - styled brotherhood morals ( and a little gunplay ) .
capone , a tough as nails super cop , gets a transfer back to his hometown of kingston after successfully taking down some gangsters that have broken into his home ( while he was with his lady ) and killed his partner in front of him .
when he arrives , he discovers that the ghetto where he grew up has gotten worse , thanks mainly to the crime boss wonie ( jamaican film veteran carl bradshaw ) , so named because his left hand has been amputated and replaced by a grasping hook ) .
capone discovers that wonie has been smuggling guns inside shipments of charity supplies for the area churches and , much to his disappointment , also finds out his childhood friend ratty ( mark danvers ) has been helping him .
torn between doing his job and protecting his best friend , capone must make some hard decisions in order to make things right again . directed deftly by first time jamaican filmmaker chris browne ( assistant director for such american films as how stella got her groove back and instinct ) , one hardly notices the film was shot on video after a while .
shots are handled so efficiently that they quickly take on the nuances of the aforementioned john woo films , although the action is n't as hyperkinetic as most of woo 's films are .
the action scenes are handled with a kind of flair though , and eventually begin to take on a life of their own
( beyond the hong kong films that they are obviously patterned after ) .
the make - up effects are particularly good in these scenes as well , with flawless squib work on display from the effects team .
the cast is superb and listening to their dialogue , spoken with thick jamaican accents ( half of which have to be subtitled because of their extensive use of slang ) ,
just adds to the interest .
paul campbell , as the ` loose cannon ' capone
, essays his role perfectly , displaying the right amount of menace and compassion at the right times .
mark danvers evokes sympathy
as ratty , the part - time gun smuggler who is also trying to help the community by building football fields and organizing block parties to bring people together .
unfortunately , carl bradshaw is given the least to do and his character as the crime boss seems ineffective ( largely because his underlings seem to run all over him ) , but then again , that could be the way his character was intended to be portrayed .
the music in the film is composed of all reggae songs , and the soundtrack was produced by grammy award winning artists , sly and robbie ( who have worked with the likes of the rolling stones , maxi priest , bob dylan , james brown , grace jones , herbie hancock , bootsy collins , and carly simon among others ) .
the end credit song , ` we run tings ' , by the group red dragon , is pretty decent and carries on the theme of the movie established early on by the quote that opens this review .
oddly enough , desmond ballentine ( who plays the character deportee ) is well known as a pioneer in the realm of ` gangsta ' reggae as the performer ninjaman , and he does n't contribute a single song to the film ( that i could see ) , which is virtually unheard of here in the us .
at the time of this writing , third world cop has been put into limited theatrical release in the us , coming off of a six - month box - office breaking run in jamaica , where it holds the position as highest grossing film of all time ( bringing in $ 21 million in jamaica , which is roughly $ 500 , 000 us ) .
palm pictures ( the company that released the offbeat , but entertaining six - string samurai ) is the company releasing the film and considering that their main focus is the dvd market , i can imagine that a disc will be available once the film has left theaters .
chris blackwell , founder of palm pictures , was also involved in the production of another jamaican box - office smash in 1981 entitled countryman , so
i 'd say he has a pretty good track record .
overall , third world cop is a pretty entertaining homage to the films of john woo , ringo lam , tsui hark , and many other action films by directors from hong kong .
if action films are your thing and you do n't mind intermittent subtitles , then
you ca n't go wrong with this film .
the performances and the story are solid
( if only a little cliched ) and the action is tight .
i 'm not sure what the other jamaican films released in that country are like , but apparently third world cop 's honors are well deserved .",1,"['essays his role perfectly', 'the action scenes are handled with a kind of flair though , and eventually begin to take on a life of their own', 'honors are well deserved', ""you ca n't go wrong with this film"", 'shots are handled so efficiently', 'directed deftly', 'flawless squib work on display from the effects team', 'pretty decent', 'just adds to the interest', 'a pretty entertaining homage', 'the action is tight', 'the cast is superb', 'the make - up effects are particularly good', 'displaying the right amount of menace and compassion at the right times', 'evokes sympathy', 'the performances and the story are solid']"
"so i went and saw this film right , it was called "" battlefield : earth ""
, i was never interested in the previews , and never too terribly interested in the book , nor do i find scientology interesting , but after reading advanced reviews of how bad this film really is , i had that weird urge just to watch it .
well let me be the first to say , and so far in my view it 's safe to say : battlefield :
earth might be the worst film i have ever seen , yes even worse than "" mr . magoo "" , "" blue in the face "" , or "" jaws : the revenge "" .
roger christianson who s credits include set direction , and art direction for such great films as "" alien "" and "" star wars "" , directs this film with such amateurism , that the film looks and feels and in fact sounds so dumb , that it 's quite depressing .
the look of the film , is dark and drabby at times , but then bright and happy at other times .
the sound is terrible , and has the worst surround sound effects i 've heard .
the acting is nothing , the dialogue poor , and the make - up effects hideous .
here 's the so - called plot : earth 3000 . . . .
man is a endangered species , while aliens from the planet psychlo ( the aliens are named psychlo .
. .
i wonder why ? ! ) are invading earth , destined to put an end to those "" man - animals "" to an end , and destroy earth once and for all , of course we have our typical hero ( played terrible by barry pepper , who was great in a small role in 1999 's "" the green mile "" ) who is destined to go out , and save his planet !
one thing : he has to go up against , terl , the chief of security psychlo , who is played frankly , quite bad by john travolta , whom with dreadlocks , a big head , and green eyes just does n't work .
of course the sidekick to terl , is played by
( lol ! ! )
forest whitaker , who looks like a deformed werewolf of some kind .
our friendly human johnny ( barry pepper ) looks just as bad as well , with long scraggly hair .
i 'm not really sure how to quite explain the badness of this film , except just to say it 's terrible .
everything in this film is imcomprehinsable , from the make - up effects , which by the way are n't good , to the phony looking special effects , everything in this film is faulted .
in fact i do n't remember one part in this entire movie where i was having a good time , or enjoying myself .
in fact there is no part in the movie that i liked or enjoyed .
throughout the entire 127 minute running time , i was dying , constantly looking at my watch , and hoping maybe the projectioner would blow a bulb or something , sadly it did n't .
my advice to hollywood : get new scripts , new acting classes , better directors and damnit , make films like american beauty more .",0,"['faulted', ""looks and feels and in fact sounds so dumb , that it 's quite depressing"", ""i 'm not really sure how to quite explain the badness"", ""it 's terrible"", 'phony looking', ""here 's the so - called plot"", 'might be the worst film i have ever seen', 'imcomprehinsable', '( lol ! ! )', ""the sound is terrible , and has the worst surround sound effects i 've heard"", 'looks just as bad', 'how bad this film really is', 'terrible', 'i was dying , constantly looking at my watch', 'played frankly , quite bad', 'directs this film with such amateurism', 'hideous']"
"by the time dennis quaid , the ostensible star of switchback , makes his first appearance at about the 22-minute mark , you may find yourself wondering why he bothered .
after all , writer / director jeb stuart has already set up a fairly promising pair of parallel story lines .
the first finds amarillo , texas sheriff buck olmstead ( r . lee ermey ) facing a hotly - contested election battle just as a brutal double homicide is discovered at a motel in his jurisdiction .
as olmstead begins his investigation , we also meet the two men who come to be our prime suspects .
lane dixon ( jared leto ) is an enigmatic young hitchhiker ; bob goodall ( danny glover ) is the jovial motorist who offers lane a ride from texas to his utah destination .
all the necessary conflicts seem to be in place -- the internal struggle of olmstead over the clash between good politics and good police work , and the external struggle as one of the two travelers eventually becomes villain to the other 's protagonist .
but then quaid shows up as grimly determined fbi agent frank lacrosse .
lacrosse is certain that the amarillo murders are the work of a serial killer he has been tracking for nearly two years .
he 's not supposed to be tracking him any more -- according to the bureau , they 've got their man -- but lacrosse has a very important reason for believing otherwise .
two months earlier , lacrosse 's own son was kidnapped by the killer , and the boy has yet to turn up anywhere .
lacrosse knows his killer 's work , and he knows that the man is still out there somewhere trying to continue their game .
it would n't be fair to reduce everything that 's wrong with switchback to quaid 's presence , but it 's a pretty good place to start .
there 's a reason lacrosse feels like an intruder in the narrative instead of its vital center :
as a dramatic actor , dennis quaid possesses exactly one facial expression and one vocal intonation .
we can tell lacrosse is determined because his face is a perpetual tight - jawed , sourpuss pucker ; we can tell he 's grim because every word comes out in an eastwood - esque rasp .
a more flexible performer might have given weight to the character , pulling the audience into his haunted intensity , making switchback _ his _ film .
quaid
merely looks annoyed and slightly constipated .
it 's tough to become emotionally invested in a character 's turmoil when it looks like all he really needs is a big bowl of bran flakes .
even without quaid , it does n't appear that switchback would have stayed on course .
the early scenes between leto and glover have a lively energy , building our curiosity over which man -- the taciturn kid or his gregarious benefactor -- is the real threat .
unfortunately , stuart tips his hand far too early in the game , both through the pitch of the individual performances and the facts he chooses to reveal .
once the mystery of the killer 's identity is dispatched , the interaction between leto and glover becomes stale and predictable
.
in fact , "" stale and predictable "" describes the direction that switchback takes in general , falling back on far - too - common hollywood devices like cats jumping out of nowhere , a climactic fistfight on board a freight train , and edgy law enforcement agents .
it 's too bad stuart was n't willing to spend more time with sheriff olmstead , far and away the most interesting and appealing character in the film .
played with atypical restraint by r .
lee ermey
, he 's a wonderful , unconventional hero who seems genuinely comfortable accepting the consequences of acting on his convictions .
a film focusing on the olmstead would have signaled a film - maker willing to take a few risks with his casting and story - telling .
instead , stuart places his trust in a "" name "" star who ca n't carry the material .
maybe next time he 'll throw away that one crucial page in the script , the one where the grimly determined fbi agent wanders onto the scene to muck up a perfectly good story .",0,"['unfortunately , stuart tips his hand far too early in the game', 'falling back on far - too - common hollywood devices', ""ca n't carry the material"", '"" stale and predictable "" describes the direction', 'merely looks annoyed and slightly constipated', 'stale and predictable', ""everything that 's wrong""]"
"suicide is pointless , everyone should know that .
so what 's this movie like ?
you guessed it . .
. pointless .
the virgin suicides focuses on the lives of the five lisbon sisters , from the perspective of the teenage boys who are fascinated by them .
when the youngest lisbon sister commits suicide , it sets in motion a series of events that will change the lives of many people forever .
that 's what the press materials for the film probably say .
now here 's what i say : the virgin suicides is a huge waste of time . boring , arty , pretentious junk
that is about as entertaining as .
. .
well as committing suicide .
the movie lost me early on , immediately following the scene where the younger daughter jumps to her death from her bedroom window .
the girl 's father ( james woods ) holds her lifeless body in his arms as their horrified family looks on .
then , as the scene ends , the lawn sprinklers come on .
is that a joke ?
is that supposed to be amusing in some way ?
from then on , the movie failed to draw me back in .
performances are the only saving grace of the virgin suicides .
woods plays the only character who would actually interest me when he came onscreen , but the performance of kirsten dunst as the next youngest daughter lux is worth mentioning as well .
dunst has the potential to be a big star , if she chooses her projects well .
and while
this film is awful , she manages to come away from it virtually unscathed .
there are also a few cameos in the film here and there , which only frustrate the audience as they leave you wanting more . as a result , they all seem rather pointless
( although there 's a brief role given to michael pare from eddie and the cruisers which turns out to be his best role since . . . well since eddie and the cruisers ) . perhaps the virgin suicides would have worked had the story not been told from the point of view of people who had very little access to the main characters .
we never get any significant insight into the girls and why they might be feeling what they 're feeling .
all we really know is that mrs .
lisbon ( kathleen turner ) is strict and keeps them on a short leash .
what mother does n't ?
it 's certainly no reason to commit suicide .
with the godfather part iii , sofia coppola proved that she had no business being in front of the camera .
with the virgin suicides ,
she proves she has no business behind it either .
having family connections does n't entitle you to be allowed to make movies .
so attention film directors . .
. stop letting your daughters pout their way into the industry .
just because they share your dna does n't mean they share your talent .

"some movies ask you to leave your brain at the door , some movies ask you to believe in the impossible to really have a good time .
playing god asks just one simple , eensy , teensy thing so it can fully entertain you ,
it 's accomplished in just four easy to follow steps : crack open your skull , scoop out your brain , squish it under your foot several times and reverse steps two and one .
congratulations , you now have all the necessary requirements to fully enjoy a whole lot of nothing .
some movies fail at the box office but you manage to see why the producers thought it could have been a good movie , others are simply good ideas that are badly executed .
then there 's playing god , which enters the esteemed category of movies which seem to have grown from the union of a drunk director , actors satisfied in the knowledge that this horrible flick will have no lasting impact on their careers and a bunch of rip - offs
( or homages as they like to call it ) from other , better movies that end up looking like an unflushed toilet .
harsh ?
maybe .
justified ?
hell yes !
this is a movie that is not just satisfied in ripping off other movies but feels the need to remind us of that fact every ten minutes .
for example , a gunman bursts into a garden with the two guns in his hands firing away .
this does look moderately kool , but the camera lingers on the actor for so long you can almost hear the director yelling : "" oooh , look look !
john woo !
two guns blazing !
slooooow motion ! ""
and if that was n't enough , you can also hear the script grunting under the effort it must take to try and make every single line of dialogue sound like something deep and meaningful like in a tarantino movie .
poor timothy hutton gets to deliver most of the corny lines , you have to admire the effort he puts into it , this guy deserves better .
unlike most movies this one does not suffer from "" stupid bad guy "" syndrome , just to make things a little different this time
we get stupid heroes .
example : duchovny manages to distract a bad guy by making him go into the bathroom to get some bandages .
now the bad guy is , like , stoned , man , so he leaves his shotgun next to our hero .
( term used as loosely as possible ) survival instincts and a good dose of common sense seems to suggest grabbing the shotgun , which our hero does , but only after contemplating it for about thirty seconds .
even when he does grab it he seems unsure how to hold it , going so far as to actually wonder if he should place a finger near the trigger .
mind you , i 've never fired a shotgun in my life but believe you me that the bad guy would be missing most of his vital organs , be he stoned or not .
some will argue that our hero does not have a killer instinct , the hell with that !
two fbi guys have just been shot in front me , along with one bad guy and the other looks like he might go ballistic at any second .
solution ?
boom !
i 'll take the time to feel sorry about it later
thank you very much .
another prime example of the idiot hero syndrome
: our boy duchovny needs to reach his girl before something bad happens to her .
he knows the head bad guy has her on the tenth floor of a building and that he might be running into a room full of people with itchy trigger fingers .
he still has his shotgun , bring it along
you say ?
no thanks , i 'll just ditch it in the back of my car .
and the real kicker is this : when he reaches the room and people start shooting at him he has the nerve to look surprised ! while we are on the subject of getting shot , why in hades were those fbi guys sitting with their backs to the door ?
i 've got no formal training but
even i know you never sit with your back to the door .
ask mr .
wild bill , the first and only time he did not sit with his back to a wall cost him his life .
this is the major problem with this movie , any mook could have thought of a hundred ways to make it better .
is it so much to ask that hollywood actually put a little common sense into their characters ?
for instance : our heroes hide at duchovny 's summer home , now the bad guys could come knocking at any moment .
ok , this time our hero does get himself a gun and has it at his side most of the time .
but see , our hero is a drug addict and guess what ?
he chooses now to go clean and suffer through dt .
oh sure , he 'll be really impressive when the bad guys come calling .
going clean is really honorable of him , but i would have waited until i did not need to be conscious or being able to fire a gun .

"at the outset of swordfish , john travolta 's gabriel shear is pontificating about the status of american cinema today .
basically , he says , it boils down to a lack of imagination among the majority of writers .
how ironic , as travolta seems to be describing his latest venture .
swordfish is loud , violent and amoral .
it has the audacity to justify murder and mayhem in the name of sustaining our way of life .
and how does travolta 's gabriel plan to do this ?
by robbing billions from his own government and using the funds to out - terrorize terrorists .
swordfish is a very cynical movie .
it relies on an audience 's perception of our leaders as ineffectual and duplicitous and on terrorists as non - human , faceless entities not worthy of compassion or consideration .
the movie 's plot is preposterous with enough illogical leaps that if the film ever slowed down , you 'd actually see how ridiculous it all is
.
this is a live - action road runner cartoon , moving so quickly that it 's over before you can catch your breath to ask any reasonable questions .
the storyline revolves around super hacker stanley jobson ( hugh jackman ) , recruited by gabriel to crack the government 's computer codes so gabriel can gather billions for his anti - terrorist campaign .
talk about whacked - out patriotism .
my objections to swordfish are many .
the body count is high , but that is expected in a movie of this sort .
it 's becoming a bore watching anonymous soldiers , police officers and government agents blown to bits .
another example is the family dynamics between stanley , his 10-year - old daughter and his ex - wife .
stanley , though having served time in prison for hacking , is shown as a loving and caring father , forbidden by his ex to see his little girl .
audience animosity is immediately created for his former spouse by showing her as a drinker and smoker who also sometimes stars in her new husband 's adult films .
thus when she is found murdered late in the movie , neither stanley nor his daughter are allowed any time to grieve .
in fact , subconsciously , many in the audience are probably glad she was killed .
then there is the sequence involving one of gabriel 's henchman holding a gun to the head of stanley 's daughter to coerce the hacker to download the key computer program for gabriel .
children as pawns have become a most unwelcome clich ?
in recent films .
there is enough violence in the real world involving children without having to make them on - screen victims as well .
yea
, it 's only make believe , but that does n't mean you have to tolerate it
.
travolta is cool , deadly charming and flamboyant as the near - crazy gabriel .
his character is reminiscent of his villainous characterizations in broken arrow and face / off .
jackman looks dour through most of the proceedings .
his only moment of any depth comes when he finally is able to create the worm to get inside the government database .
his sense of joy and accomplishment is one any computer whiz can appreciate .
halle berry is decorative and lovely as gabriel 's assistant , while don cheadle is given little to do as the head fbi agent hunting gabriel .
swordfish plays like a comic book with a larger - than - life character in gabriel .
viewers align themselves with him despite their uncertainty if he is hero or villain .
and maybe that is the movie 's underlying flaw : there is no real hero to speak of , only those doing their upmost to survive .
and that is not enough .
this is one swordfish that should have been thrown back in the water .",0,"['a most unwelcome clich ? in recent films', 'loud , violent and amoral . it has the audacity to justify murder and mayhem in the name of sustaining our way of life', 'given little to do', 'looks dour through most of the proceedings', 'plays like a comic book', 'my objections to swordfish are many', 'should have been thrown back in the water', 'that is not enough', ""preposterous with enough illogical leaps that if the film ever slowed down , you 'd actually see how ridiculous it all is"", ""that does n't mean you have to tolerate it""]"
"i looked at the "" internet movie database "" 's awards section for this film , and found that this was nominated for a golden globe for "" best picture ( drama ) .
""
anyone who 's seen this film can back me up on this :
this is the worst of the "" great "" disaster films , and that 's not really saying a lot for this film .
"" earthquake "" is basically notable because it originally included some theatre thing where the theatre shook when the big earthquake occured . on video ,
it 's a bland and slow - moving film which gives us a bunch of different characters ( the disaster film requisite ) , then brings them together in the struggle against the big disaster .
while this worked in , say , "" the towering inferno , "" it does n't here for one single reason : we do n't care about any of the characters .
the film gives us charlton heston ( in one of many crap 70s films he made , including "" skyjacked "" and that classic , "" soylent green "" ) as a rich man married to ava gardner , who is having a little affair with a young single mom ( genieveve bujold ) ; a renegade police officer on suspension ( george kennedy , in his least humored performance ) ; in the second weirdest subplot , a motorcycle stuntman ( richard roundtree , right after his "" shaft "" thing ) whose big stunt is he goes on a little track that goes upside down
( yea , snore ) ; and the weirdest subplot : a military man / bag boy at a grocery store who has a little thing for buxom victoria principal , and eventually gets vengeance on those guys who made fun of his hair
( ! ! ! ) . in smaller subplots , there 's a pointless bit about people who are flying over l . a .
( the city in the film , by the way ) , one who 's playing cards and married to a boring non - acting husband ( you think this one can go nowhere ?
guess again .
he gets interested in the final frames ) ; there 's genieveve bujold 's moron son , who has a little adventure with wires ; and for some much - needed comedy , there 's walter matthau ( billed as walter mutha . . .
.
- the only laugh in the film ) , as a wild drunkard , who 's big moment is a dance he does at a critical time .
as for the actual "" earthquake , "" it 's rather a
let - down .
there 's a full hour of character - setups , none of which is interesting , then about 10 minutes of shaking , crumbling , and a bit where a house almost falls on bujold ( narrowly missing ) .
this film needed that whole theatre - shaking :
they needed to wake everybody up because they were so bored
.
there 's little suspense following the quake , although this film tries for it .
there 's an adventure in a crumbling high - rise office building , the wires with the kid , and the movement of people who are all injured .
but none of these are all - too suspenseful .
the finale with the heston / gardner / bujold love triangle is ended in a basic flip - of - the - coin bit , which brings out a big let - down .

even "" volcano "" ended nicely , and that movie really sucked .
not only is it hokey , but you do n't care about any character . who cares if heston dies ? who cares if he choses bujold or gardner ( although i would have chosen gardner , mainly on the basis that she can actually act ) ? who cares if richard roundtree makes money on his stupid "" stunt ?

if anything , "" earthquake "" is worth a viewing for the same reason "" glen or glenda ? "" is .

"the "" italian hitchcock "" and acknowledged master of the giallo murder - mystery dario argento again offers us a fascinating turn on the formula in pheneomena .
this time the twist comes in the form of jennifer corvino ( jennifer connelly ) , a bright teenager with gift for telepathically communicating with insects .
sent to a girls boarding school in switzerland , she soon learns of a series of bizarre disappearances and at least one murder that has the school 's population terrified .
a chance meeting with a brilliant entomologist ( donald pleasance ) leads the two of them to team up and solve the mystery with the aid of her remarkable gift .
phenomena is an imaginative , original thriller .
writer / director argento creates several sequences of surreal , haunting beauty here , including a masterfully shot sleepwalking episode and a striking scene when a swarm of flying insects descends on the school at jennifer 's beckoning .
the plot takes some wonderfully bizarre turns and the killer 's identity is genuinely shocking and surprising .
the director took a big gamble with a soundtrack that mixes elements as diverse as heavy metal band iron maiden , ex - rolling stone bill wyman , and argento 's favourite gothic / electronic outfit goblin .
but
it gels surprisingly well .
the film 's opening music reccurs several times , an eerie and evocative score that perfectly sets the overall tone .
argento fans beware : the film was released outside europe in a terribly butchered form re - titled as creepers .
this deleted nearly half an hour of footage , mainly of key dialogue scenes .",1,"['a masterfully shot', 'it gels surprisingly well', 'genuinely shocking and surprising', 'perfectly sets the overall tone', 'a fascinating turn on the formula', 'an imaginative , original thriller']"
"i ca n't recall a previous film experience where the fairly good time i was having turned as sour as quickly as it did during feeling minnesota . for forty minutes or so , i was lured into a loopy if occasionally over - wrought romantic comedy , and i was even giving keanu reeves the benefit of the doubt .
then , rather suddenly , i was clubbed over the head with a nasty bit of violence ; shortly thereafter , i was whacked in the gut by another .
feeling minnesota is a film that made me feel violated , as though i had trusted writer - director steven baigelman to bring me a cool glass of water
and instead he threw acid in my face .
feeling minnesota tells the story of a topless dancer named freddie ( cameron diaz ) who finds herself in deep trouble when her boss red ( delroy lindo ) suspects her of stealing from him .
red 's punishment is to force freddie to marry his bookkeeper , sam clayton ( vincent d'onofrio ) , who is far from the man of freddie 's dreams .
enter jjaks ( keanu reeves ) , sam 's estranged younger brother , who arrives at the wedding just in time to catch freddie 's eye and have sex with her in the bathroom .
united in their mutual attraction and their mutual loathing of sam , jjaks and freddie take off together , but sam is n't ready to let them go without a fight .
freddie , meanwhile , is n't ready to let sam 's money go without a fight , and thus begins a series of violent confrontations .
there is both style and substance to the beginning of feeling minnesota , as baigelman opens with an effective montage showing jjaks and sam 's intense sibling rivalry as boys , and their mother ( tuesday weld ) sending jjaks away to live with his father .
it does a great job of setting up jjaks ' unstable life , a life which has landed him in trouble for petty crimes and always trying to please his family ; reeves ' wounded look is just right for jjaks .
the wedding sequence includes a number of nice moments , most notably the aforementioned bathroom scene in which a simple question is given a very funny spin .
most important , baigelman begins to establish the connection between freddie and jjaks with humor and economy , as in a scene where they both spontaneously begin singing along to the replacements ' "" i will dare "" on the car radio .
you would have every reason to expect that relationships -- both familial and romantic -- would be the focal point of feeling minnesota .
unfortunately , you would be dead wrong .
i suppose i should have expected daisies and valentines after an early scene in which red threatens freddie as she tries to avoid the wedding , but i certainly did n't expect what i got .
what i got was yet another in a long line of recent films trying to ride the tarantino wave by mixing gags and brutality , or rather creating gags about brutality .
suddenly , the story of romantic entanglements and family conflict becomes a story about a corpse , and everything which had come before degenerates so completely that virtually nothing is recognizable .
the sibling rivalry not only becomes little more than an excuse for one round of beatings after another , but there is no consistency to the characterizations .
vincent d'onofrio turns in a manic performance as sam , whose jealousy , competitiveness and apparent sense of inferiority seem far more in keeping with what we know about jjaks , while reeves turns into a framed hero too reminiscent of chain reaction , and both of them spend most of the second half of the film screaming and covered in blood .
there are films which have managed to employ a radical shift in tone successfully ( jonathan demme 's something wild and neil jordan 's the crying game come to mind ) , but they did n't try to draw an audience with the promise of relatively innocuous entertainment .
i do n't want to dismiss baigelman 's successes out of hand -- he gets a fun performance out of dan aykroyd as a crooked cop , and some well - crafted comic moments -- and it is not his fault that fine line has chosen to promote feeling minnesota as a light - hearted caper .
it
_ is _ his fault that he violates his own characters for the sake of shock value , and that he ca n't make his two halves into a whole .

"i was born in 1970 , which makes me barely old enough to remember bell buttons , 8 tracks and disco .
however , since i was 17 years old i 've seen more than my share of adult films .
i mention this only because i thinks its important to state up front that i 'm not against pornogrpahy .
i 've seen enough of these films to know the range of content and quality available .
director paul thomas anderson 's boogie nights offers us a view into the world of porn during the period considered to be the golden age of adult cinema , the mid to late 70s .
this was the period when x - rated movies were real movies , shot on film , shown in movie theaters and even reviewed by legitimate critics .
this was an age when porn directors actually aspired to make innovative often educational films , films that attempted to tell a real story .
one of the more fascinating aspects of this film is how , like in an any other billion dollar industry , the creative visionaries tend to be ignorant to the trends that will soon make them obsolete .
in this case , the arrival of the now ubiquitous videocassette .
burt reynold 's manages to resuscitate his career portraying such an auteur , known as jack horner .
horner 's has a steady "" family "" of performers , some of whom live in his plush l . a . home .
but in the world of porn , performers are a commodity - the fresher , the better .
when horner scouts a fresh faced stud bussing tables at his favorite discotheque , he decides to add him to his stable .
it is a pairing that leads to a meteoric rise and fall for a young man reaching his prime and an old man rapidly speeding past his . as directed by anderson , the camera moves through many of the scenes with an eerie omnipresence and an almost childlike curiosity to peer beyond the closed door .
boogie nights provides a voyeuristic peep into the underbelly of l . a . 's hardcore film scene .
but the peep show doesnut let us walk away when the titillation ends .
the downside of voyeurism is sometimes we end up seeing things we wish we hadnut .
by the film 's final image , what we we once found titillating has now become a grim reminder of the vanity of fame and the high price of realizing your dreams .
boogie nights is not about sex .
it does not glorify porn or the lifestyles of the performers .
in fact , the film is n't really about pornography at all .
pornography is merely the setting to tell a compelling story about a lost and forgotten group of people who form their own sub - culture to find acceptance of who they are .
the film goes to brilliant , often hilarious and sometimes harrowing lengths to show us that the people who choose to produce or perform in these films are generally not all that bright and lack the basic tools to function in the mainstream world .
yet , like in the lauded tarantino films , these people still have their own moral code , their own concepts of integrity and their own needs to experess themselves creatively .
the characters we meet are like a road map of dysfuntion .
first stop , the den mother ( julianne moore ) in denial about her addiction to cocaine as she tries to retain custody of her son .
second stop , the cuckold crewman ( william h . macy ) who keeps discovering his wife having sex with anyone and everyone ( the wife is played in hilarious cameos by real - life porn star nina hartley ) .
but the driving force behind the plot is 17 year old eddie adams .
eddie is blessed with a natural endowment so famous that people actually pay just to see it .
with no real ambition of his own , he hooks up with jack horner to fullfill his destiny of fame .
his alcoholic mother , clearly dissatisfied with her own lot , abuses him verbally and drives him out of the house .
horner introduces him to amber waves ( moore ) who immediately adopts him , a nuclear family is born .
the surrogate relationship that develops between amber waves and her "" babies "" provides some of the films most poignant scenes .
clearly , she is not even fit to manage her own life , let alone nurture these lost children .
but the need to love and be loved is so strong
, they easily ignore the dangers of the less subtle addiction she introduces them to .
even the viewer is somehow lulled into feeling like the love she offers is similar to being in a real family .
then again , perhaps its not so different from real families at all .
eddie adams , who later takes on the screen name "" dirk diggler "" , is skillfully acted by former pop - star , mark wahlberg .
i say "" former "" pop star because with this performance wahlberg can officially quit his day job .
this is bold and brave territory for such a young man .
he pulls it off marvelously .
wahlberg is a "" big , bright star "" with a big bright future .
boogie nights plays very much in the spirit of the people versus larry flynt , without the first amendment preachiness .
its intimate studies of character make it the superior film .
wahlberg 's surprising performance is on par with woody harrelson 's .
but in my opinion , boogie nights , is not the best film of the year .
i got the feeling that itus 2 1/2 hour running time could have been cut by 15 or 20 minutes without losing any of its resonance .
still , if the subject matter of this film intimidates you , thereus no doubt that once you start watching boogie nights you may still feel like its not your thing , but youull find yourself grooving to it anyway .
. .
ya know , kinda like disco .",1,"['its intimate studies of character make it the superior film', 'brilliant , often hilarious and sometimes harrowing lengths', 'he pulls it off marvelously']"
"where do i begin ?
okay , how about with this : starship troopers is one of the worst movies to hit theaters in a long time .
in fact , it might even be the worst * major * release film to come out in years . . .
or even a decade .
this is bad beyond belief .
i would * not * suggest paying money to see this .
there 's a good chance you 'll regret it .
if you see it for free , you could still want to walk out .
go right ahead .
the movie starts off with cheesy 90210 scenes set in the future world of . . .
buenos aires .
here we meet the group of horrendously bad actors and actresses playing obnoxious , easy - to-
* despise * -with - a - passion characters that have love triangles , love rectangles , and love hexagons screwing up their life .
before long they all go off and join the military , primarily in the interest of having sex with the other youngsters that joined .
they train .
they strut around nude for no reason whatsoever .
after an hour of making the audience scream in agony , they start fighting bugs .
the big bugs look nice , even though their design is only "" okay . "" unfortunately ,
the fights are boring since we * want * all of the characters dead anyway .
cue more agony .
then some characters have sex .
then some more die .
*
* * who cares ? ? ?
*
* * cue more agony .
the movie ends , the audience runs out to their cars , vomits over the pavement , and attempts to drive home .
unfortunately , after that torture , they ca n't think straight , do n't pay attention to the road , and many are in ugly car wrecks .
you remember how batman & robin was bad ?
well , batman & robin kicked this movie 's sorry butt , people .
starship troopers does not succeed as an action movie .
it does not succeed as a drama .
it does not succeed as a war movie .
it does not succeed as a comedy .
it does not succeed as a satire .
it does not succeed as a parody .
it succeeds as being horrible . terrible .
gut - wrenchingly bad .
i wanted to run away from that movie every minute .
but i paid my money and i owed it to others to see if the movie got any better .
so i stayed .
it never got better .
frequently , it did the impossible , and got * worse * .
the movie as written , acted , directed , and basically just feels as a whole like it 's about on the mental maturity level of a free willy 4 .
the whole thing feels like a movie that only three - year - olds could enjoy .
. .
except for the ridiculously gratuitous blood and gore , and pointless nudity .
it 's written for little children , but children should definitely * not * go anywhere near it .
of course , i recommend the same for everyone .
do n't go anywhere near it .
verhoeven 's got a streak going now .
his last movie was showgirls .
he seems to be trying to see how bad his movies can get before people finally stop coming .
showgirls was a failure , but it appears that , though it 'll be lucky to make near its budget , this movie will still do okay gross - wise .
is it really
*
all * bad ?
well , no .
troopers has about four or five lines of dialouge / short humorous scenes that are actually funny , mostly from the "" do you want to know more ?
"" commercials that pop up throughout the story , promoting the joys of the joining the troopers .
so that adds up to about 30 seconds of entertainment and still about one hour , 59 minutes , and 30 seconds of miserable torture .
i 'm totally confused as to the way that some people are really enjoying this movie .
but i do admit it .
so , if you 're willing to possibly put yourself through torture , go ahead and see it , and decide for yourself if you love it or hate it .
i do n't know how anyone or any * thing * could love this movie , but hey , to each his own .
feel free to give it a shot .
of course , in the interest of saving your souls , i do n't recommend it .
but guess what ?
alien resurrection comes out november 26th , and , having already seen some of it and having read the script , i assure you that it will blow pretty much everyone away .
though opinion on starship troopers is reasonably split , it 'll be difficult to find someone that * wo n't * like alien resurrection when they 've seen it .
this is possibly the year 's best intense action film , or at least * one * of the best .
if you really want to see alien warfare that 's played out intelligently and seriously , see alien resurrection .
please , avoid this .",0,"['this is bad beyond belief', 'the ridiculously gratuitous blood and gore , and pointless nudity', 'please , avoid this .', 'it succeeds as being horrible . terrible . gut - wrenchingly bad . i wanted to run away from that movie every minute', ""do n't go anywhere near it"", 'horrendously bad actors and actresses playing obnoxious , easy - to- * despise * -with - a - passion characters', 'the fights are boring', 'after that torture', 'one of the worst movies to hit theaters in a long time . in fact , it might even be the worst * major * release film to come out in years', 'miserable torture', 'making the audience scream in agony', ""i do n't recommend it""]"
""" first rule of fight club is , do n't talk about fight club .
""
this quote deals directly with my opinion of this film , because quite frankly ,
it 's not even worth mentioning .
director david fincher ( seven ) has completely gone over the edge . with crude humor , an intolerable script and 2 hours and 19 minutes of pure torture ,
i 'm surprised i did n't walk out
.
this just goes to show that hype kills .
it 's very rare that a film so hyped up as "" fight club "" turns out to be noteworthy , and this is no exception .
the story goes like this .
edward norton is an insomniac trying to enlighten his dull life by going to a variety of disease therapy sessions , until he meets marla ( helena bonham carter ) .
norton claims that she is wrecking his pleasurable lifestyle , when he spots her at a session that he also attended .
apparently the disease sessions help them see what life is like , literally living in pain .
why any person would think of such a thing is beyond me , but things do get worse .
norton is soon assigned to a job that calls for traveling , and it 's on a plane that he meets tyler durden ( brad pitt ) .
the two men develop a bond , and go out to a bar , and by golly after they get drunk , the two pitiful characters fight .
how do they come up with this stuff ?
anyway , their fighting catches other pathetic loser 's attention , and a club is formed .
out of all this mess , there manages to lie a message .
fincher shows us that society is like robots .
we work in our jobs doing things step by step , and want out .
our insanity gets to our brain and makes things worse than they really are , and we blame it on others .
call me crazy , but this is common knowledge .
i think fincher was acting as if the film is moodier and more poignant than it really is , which is probably one of the reasons it fails miserably .
even with two good actors , and a solid actress , they only manage to weaken the story .
i could n't help but hide my face in shame when norton beats himself up into a bloody pulp .
it just shows how desperate the script is for attention .
i guess brad pitt was right for this role , because i felt like beating him up myself .
his bothersome and depressing character
, made me disgusted at his 20 million fee .
it only showed me that he was in it for the money and nothing more .
helena bonham carter however really had no purpose .
she just popped up on screen , mumbled some lines , smoked and left .
this continues for what seems like 6 hours .
the film drags on and my headache gets bigger , while "" fight club "" nears what i think might be the end .
unfortunately by then , the film hits rock bottom .
though the conclusion kept my interest for a mere 5 minutes , it backs down again and continues to move at a snails pace
.
on a side note , the trailer shows the only redeeming elements of the film , that coincidentally lasts the same amount of time that they did on the trailer .
fincher will hopefully regret making this film or at least learn a lesson .
concentrating on the atmosphere or a particular key moment , wo n't do any good if everything else is in need of support .
also , i 'm afraid that immature men might respond to the film 's violence .
the last thing the world needs is people praising a leader of a pointless cult .
when the film ends , i 'm just glad to get home and take some advil .
you 'll either enjoy what the film has to offer , or agree with ed norton when he says
"" this is so f
*
* * ing stupid .

"will hunting ( matt damon ) is a natural genius .
for a movie character , that 's usually a death sentence .
it 's a trait associated with what my brother calls "" too good for this world "" movies , like phenomenon or powder .
forgive me for spoiling the ending , but will does n't die .
this is no formula movie .

it 's a character study more than anything , and that 's not surprising , considering it was written by two actors : damon and co - star ben affleck .

he speed reads books on any academic subject that interests him .
on - screen he hangs out with his friends , picking fights in robust , romanticized - hemingway fashion .
lambeau ( stellan skarsgard from breaking the waves ) , a math professor , learns that the janitor ( will ) is a genius with a special talent for advanced mathematics .
having confirmed he 's not a fluke or a savant , he does what he can to get will into the education system .
he is firmly rejected .
finally , will lands in jail for one of his fights .
lambeau can get him probation instead of prison time as long as will agrees to therapy sessions and to discussing mathematics with him .
will ( barely ) decides to go for the therapy over prison .
lambeau treats will like a son .
he 's proud of , and amazed by , will 's accomplishments in mathematics .
he encourages will and tries to give him structure , knowing that , with a little discipline , he could be bigger than einstein .
will is n't really interested in academia .
he knows he would be the best in his field , and therefore spend all of his time in an office , explaining math to people like lambeau .
he would rather work construction , which breaks lambeau 's heart .
meanwhile , will attends his mandated therapy sessions .
it 's not long before he shreds all the therapists on lambeau 's "" a "" list .
will has read enough psychology to know the tricks of the trade , and how to keep them from affecting him .
shrink after shrink refuses to return after will 's mockery .
lambeau 's last hope is his old college roommate , now a psychology teacher at a small - time community college .
knowing that will is going to try to shred him too , sean ( robin williams ) agrees to take him on as a favor to lambeau and for the chance to meet this next einstein .
true to form , will finds sean 's emotional weakness and attacks .
but unlike the other shrinks , sean knows what he is in for and continues the sessions .
like a foster mother with a fussy child , sean knows that the attacks are defensive and is able to take them in stride .
like the foster mother , sean knows that time and quiet patience is the only approach .
robin williams is excellent in this role .
he 's not an actor with a great range , but in the right roles he has great depth
.
in this movie , as in awakenings , there comes a point when the quiet , shy man accomplishes something of great personal importance , and a smile of pure joy spreads up to his eyes .
williams is the only actor i can name who can make an audience cry just by smiling .
i have compared will to a foster child and that 's not entirely fair .
emotionally , he has a lot to learn , but he is not a child .
he has thought about his life and made rational decisions about what he wants .
sean , his girlfriend , his pals , and lambeau all
help him grow , but he did n't start out asking for , or particularly needing , help .
his exceptional gift singled him out , and those who love him kept pushing him in the right direction .
if i had to say anything bad about good will hunting is that it walks the line between drama and melodrama .
it 's too sentimental and uplifiting for a straight drama , but the emotions are too subtle for melodrama .
it is emotionally engaging , but it 's not quite larger than life .
this is n't a problem per se , but at times i did n't know quite how to take it .
but this is a relatively small complaint about a very good movie .
a good movie allows its characters to learn and grow .
it does n't just happen ; it takes a good script , good acting , and good direction .
good will hunting has all three . if you are at all inclined to see it , by all means , go .",1,"['is excellent in this role', 'by all means , go', 'it is emotionally engaging', ""it 's quite fresh and original"", 'good will hunting has all three', 'the only actor i can name who can make an audience cry just by smiling', 'in the right roles he has great depth', 'a very good movie']"

it contains parts of bringing up baby , any hepburn / tracy film , part of the plot of war games , cary grant and rosalind russell in his girl friday , elevator shaft action , train action , and murder .
it is cute , funny , suspenseful
( a little bit ) , sexy ( a little bit ) .
one of the bad guys was a surprise .
the pace is fast enough , there are some "" action "" scenes .
i think that this is a reasonable family summer movie for families with older kids who have already seen maverick .
julia roberts and nick nolte are fine separately and together .
i really identified with the julia roberts character ( wishful thinking , i know ! ) , but i do have better hair !
her hair , a very dull dark brown , has no color .
she could use some highlights .
they both do fine with their roles : he 's a bored columnist with the chicago chronicle and she 's a hotshot "" cub "" reporter with the chicago globe .
they have great fun trying to out scoop each other to solve one case throughout this movie .
i like the one story focus
.
other actors include charles martin smith as roberts ' boss , olympia dukakis as nolte 's coworker , nora dunn also with the chronicle , and marsha mason as a congresswoman .

"nosferatu the vampyre ( germany 1979 )
a film review by mike watson copyright 1999
mike watson
this extraordinary re - telling of bram stoker 's "" dracula "" by german filmmaker werner herzog deserves the most prominent of places in cinematic vampire lore .
inspired by f .
w .
murnau 's 1922 silent film of the same name
, herzog 's film is a work of exquisite bleakness , an oddly touching tragedy with a beautiful and uniquely haunting quality that lingers long afterwards .
the original full - length english and german language versions of nosferatu have at last received a video release by u . s .
distributor anchor bay entertainment , and in gorgeous widescreen prints .
until now only a shortened english language version of the film was available on video , and only in europe .
both of these re - releases restore the film to its full length , but viewers should still be wary of the english version due to its often stilted dialogue .
apparently the english dialogue coach herzog had on the set during filming was incompetent , and some of the voices also seem to be dubbed .
the german version with english subtitles remains the definitive one .
everyone knows the story of dracula .
or do they ?
his story has been so bastardised on film over the years that a brief reminder of the basic plot certainly wo n't hurt .
jonathan harker is a young lawyer sent to the gloomy castle dracula in transylvania to do business with a creepy count ( played by klaus kinski ) who wants to buy a house in harker 's hometown .
upon seeing a photo of harker 's wife ( the radiant isabelle adjani ) he instantly falls in love with her .
locking harker up in his castle , he sets off on a long journey to meet this woman whose beauty so bewitches him . upon divining his identity as a vampire , adjani seduces the count and lures him to his death one morning as the sun rises .
that is a story familiar to millions , but herzog has elevated stoker 's tale into the realm of - and i use this term a tad reluctantly - cinematic art .
nosferatu is as much a meditation as it is a film , shot through blue - ish and white filters and peopled with characters who perform as if they were half hypnotised .
the film 's surreal , dream - like quality is utterly mesmerising .
there is much to enjoy , but i 'll limit my praise to a few key points .
holding the film together is kinski 's remarkable performance as count dracula .
past screen portrayals , including bela lugosi 's famous turn , have largely been one dimensional and tended towards camp .
but kinski . . .
oh boy
, this is something far more compelling .
aided by a startling make - up job , he portrays dracula 's vampirism not simply as pure evil
but as some sort of loathsome disease .
this man is dreadfully lonely .
he lives in utter solitude , shunned by the locals for his hideous appearance and reputation for bloodlust .
kinski 's portrayal of the count is both creepy and deeply affecting .
when he dies , you almost feel as if this man 's tortured soul has been freed at last .
then there 's the unforgettable soundtrack , largely composed by german group popul vuh .
it is so eerily beautiful and evocative
that it 's quite impossible to imagine the film without it .
popul vuh are longtime herzog collaborators and play an ancient - sounding kind of spacemusic using piano , chants , and exotic instruments .
when i first saw this film some years ago i was so impressed i tracked down and bought a number of their albums .
the one i still listen to the most is "" tantric songs "" , from which most of the music in nosferatu is taken .
it 's a testament to the music 's depth that it is as powerful without the pictures as it is with them .
the album is still available on the highly respected ambient and world music label celestial harmonies .
this is a timely re - release by anchor bay .
after francis ford coppola 's unscary and woefully overblown version of bram stoker 's tale in 1992 , it is a joy to go back to herzog 's film and see the amazing things he has done with what is now a century - old story .
to some aficionados , nosferatu is quite simply the greatest vampire film ever made .
without a doubt , it is an unmistakable classic of the genre .
do n't miss it .",1,"[""it is a joy to go back to herzog 's film and see the amazing things"", 'this is something far more compelling', 'eerily beautiful and evocative', 'an oddly touching tragedy with a beautiful and uniquely haunting quality', 'much to enjoy', 'remarkable performance', 'the unforgettable soundtrack', 'both creepy and deeply affecting', 'quite simply the greatest vampire film ever made', 'an unmistakable classic', ""do n't miss it"", 'utterly mesmerising']"
""" footloose "" has only one goal in mind : to reel in an audience with cheesy sentiment and feel - good antics .
and i hate to admit it ; i fell for it .
the movie is about a teenager ( bacon ) who moves to a small town from the big city , and discovers that dancing has been banned by the local reverend ( lithgow ) .
he ends up falling for the preacher 's daughter ( singer ) and showing the whole town what the magic of dance can do .
as mentioned at the beginning of this review , "" footloose "" is an extremely hokey and predictable teen drama .
there are virtually no surprises , and the writing is second - rate .
so
why did i enjoy it so much ? for one thing ,
the cast is great .
kevin bacon oozes charisma in an early role .
we 're rooting for him right from the start , and , unlike most films of this genre , bacon does n't play him as the "" rebel without a clue "" sort .
yes , he does rebel , but he 's also polite when he needs to be .
and he never broods .
the rest of the cast is equally impressive .
john lithgow , seen here playing a normal guy for a change , is playing a man who would normally be a flat out villian .
but lithgow plays him as a concerned father who is trying to do what he feels is best for his daughter .
by the end of the film , we feel a genuine sense of love and understanding between him and the lori singer character .
another nice touch is the music .
we see the parents of the kids complaining that the music they listen to is filled with "" sexual innuendos "" , but that 's not true at all .
the title track , performed by kenny loggins , is upbeat and fun .
during the final sequence , i was overcome with the urge to get off the couch and start dancing
.
of course , i soon realized that would be a little pathetic .
anyway , "" footloose "" is a charming little surprise .
do n't let the premise prevent you from watching it .
it sucked me in , and it 'll do the same to you .",1,"['i was overcome with the urge to get off the couch and start dancing', 'the cast is great', 'is upbeat and fun', 'a charming little surprise', 'equally impressive', 'i fell for it', 'why did i enjoy it so much ?', ""do n't let the premise prevent you from watching it"", ""it sucked me in , and it 'll do the same to you"", 'another nice touch is the music']"
"what is a scary movie anyhow ? is it a movie where a person gets ripped to shreds ?
is it where a person is being chased by some damned teenager who wants revenge ?
possibly its some guy with a hook who wants to know what you did last summer .
what ever happened to horror movies , where the horror was in the atmosphere , and in the characters .
movies like "" halloween "" and "" psycho "" which revolutionized horror genre forever , but wait in 1973 came a movie based on the bestselling book by william peter blatty , entitled "" the exorcist "" , the movie opened to rave reviews , and scared audiences to death , now in the year 2000 "" the exorcist "" comes back to the big screen in a version you 've never seen complete with six channel digital surround sound , and fifteen minutes of new footage never before seen as long as a new ending .
chris mcniell is an actress living in georgetown washington with her twelve year old daughter regan .
while working on a new film , chris still stays close to regan , but starts to wonder why her bed shakes at night , and why regan starts to have convulsions all of a sudden .
when chris finds out that regan is possessed by a demon , she shuns at the fact of it , but considers getting a priest to help her daughter .
father karras ( jason miller ) is the man they bring in , his mother has just died , and still in mourning he decides to help this little girl .
christ , father karras , and their nanny sharon ( kitty winn ) have to sit and wait until a man shows up , that man is the exorcist , and that man will help this little girl .
excrutiatingly scary , the exorcist is a classic horror film , which twenty seven years later still scares audiences half to death .
now we get to the experience "" the exorcist "" the way it was meant to be seen in a director 's cut which incorpates fifteen minutes of new footage cut by friedkin at the time of the release for content and time , a new ending has been added as well , and adds more of a lighter feeling to the movie , which i prefer the original darker ending more .
the movie has also been remastered in a wonderful six channel digital sound mix , and is amazing .
the voices are all clear , the music pours out on you and engulfs you in richness .
as a director friedkin has been well known for other films , but his standout film is "" the exorcist "" nominated for several academy awards it one a few , but was somehow doubted best picture , best actress ( ellen burstyn ) and best supporting actress ( linda blair ) who at the age of i believe thirteen does a wonderful job of being a little girl , alone , possessed and unable to stop what is going on .
ellen burstyn i think gives her best performance to date , and can be seen currently in "" requiem for a dream "" to which she is getting rave reviews for .
jason miller ( jason patrik 's dad ) is amazing as father karras , and his performance will be forever embedded in my mind , to me
he is the character who makes the entire film float along .
i was saddened when i saw this film with an audience of mostly younger people to see them laughing at this movie , i in no way , think that this movie is comical , yes some of the stuff regan says is funny , but they were laughing at her head spinning , and the green pea soup , come on people this is some creepy stuff !
anyway the re - release of the film has managed to make $ 40 million dollars , and is still going .
hopefully one day they re - release it again in twenty years for more generations to come to enjoy .",1,"['his performance will be forever embedded in my mind', 'does a wonderful job', 'amazing . the voices are all clear , the music pours out on you and engulfs you in richness', 'remastered in a wonderful', 'a classic horror film , which twenty seven years later still scares audiences half to death', 'gives her best performance to date', 'amazing']"
"this reviewer is ignorant of what hands were responsible for delivering the original version of the abyss in 1989 . whether it was the meddling of studio executives , or the work of writer / director james cameron himself , the original cut of this underwater sci - fi thriller was entertaining enough but also quite seriously flawed .
the main problem was fairly simple : the film 's climax was unworthy of its build - up .
someone at 20th century fox - and no doubt cameron himself - must have agreed , because in 1993 came the theatrical release of the abyss : special edition .
now available on video , it seems timely to re - evaluate what , in its newly revamped state , is now a near - masterpiece despite its borrowings from films like 2010 : odyssey two , alien and close encounters of third kind .
the plot is thus .
we meet the crew of an experimental underwater mobile oil rig designed by the hard - nosed lindsay ( mastrantonio ) and captained by her soon - to - be - divorced husband bud ( ed harris ) .
the rig and its crew are diverted from their normal duties when the navy seeks their help in investigating the mysterious sinking of a u . s . nuclear submarine .
requiring a dive part - way down a three mile deep trench , three navy divers arrive to command the operation , led by the edgy lieutenant coffey ( biehn ) .
but a series of strange sightings soon convinces at least one member of the civilian crew that whoever or whatever they 're dealing with , as she memorably puts it , "" are n't speaking russian "" .
meanwhile on the surface a hurricane is brewing and , even worse , a series of incidents around cuba involving russians ships and an increasingly nervous u . s .
navy sets off an international crisis of possible catastrophic proportions .
this crisis is mirrored in the confines of the now isolated underwater rig , with the trigger - happy and increasingly paranoid lieutenant coffey at odds with the crew about how do deal with the mysterious goings - on around them .
the human drama is often riveting , with the principal players performing with an intensity that recalls the fine ensemble acting in cameron 's aliens .
the stunts , hardware , special effects and underwater cinematography are all outstanding .
and so they should be : cameron 's technical credentials are well established .
but what ultimately makes the film so gripping is three intersecting plot strands
: 1 ) the tension between old sparring partners lindsay and ex - hubby bud ; 2 ) the war of wills between the civilian crew and the navy divers as a series of escalating crisis ' befall them ; and 3 ) the slowly unfolding revelation of what lies at the bottom of the three mile deep abyss .
the abyss : special edition is an improvement on the original film in two major respects .
one is that it further fleshes out the relationship between bud and lindsay , a relationship at times touching , at others incredibly intense and volatile .
the second improvement is the restoration of some absolutely crucial scenes towards the film 's end , when the aliens demonstrate their control over water with a terrifying and extraordinary display of power to a world on the brink of nuclear war .
with the inclusion of these startling scenes , the story 's climax is now given real weight .
why on earth were they left out of the original ?
this reviewer finds it utterly incomprehensible .
so then , we have 25 minutes of additional footage that 's turned a decent underwater thriller into something quite magnificent .
i say "" quite "" because some flaws do remain .
the most grating is several moments of corny hollywood schmaltz - some new , some old - that may well have you reaching for the barf bag .
nonetheless , the abyss : special edition now stands this somewhat maligned film among james cameron 's greatest achievements , alongside aliens and terminator 2 . see it and be moved , gripped and spellbound .",1,"['intersecting plot strands', 'be moved , gripped and spellbound', 'greatest achievements', 'riveting', 'outstanding', 'quite magnificent', 'an improvement on the original film']"

if jonathan lynn 's latest comedy relied simply on jokes of that caliber -- and it certainly tries -- then it 'd be an innocuous if rather obvious little film . instead , its failings go much deeper .
first off , who has n't had enough of the tough wiseguy intimidates the timid wise guy genre ?
if you want to make a pretty penny or two in hollywood nowadays simply write a "" comedy "" which pairs a robert de niro / james caan / bruce willis type with a billy crystal / hugh grant / matthew perry type and wait for the royalties to roll in .
who 's next ?
jack nicholson and martin short ?
it certainly does n't have to be funny .
""
the whole nine yards "" is not a particularly funny film , but it is borderline offensive
.
offensive in the way it continues a trend of poking fun at career criminals who would n't think twice about pushing your mother - in - law off the brooklyn bridge with her feet encased in concrete .
that might sound like a funny sight gag , but the problem is these films have long since lost sight of the fact that taking a human life is n't all that funny to begin with .
when the corpse is placed in a car , doused with gasoline , set ablaze and referred to as "" barbecue , "" it makes you wonder when all this playing killing for laughs is going to end .
""
the whole nine yards "" is also offensive in so much as its three central female characters are portrayed as nothing more than sex objects .
rosanna arquette plays a slutty , chain - smoking french canadian who 's married to matthew perry 's none - too - successful dentist .
it 's an unflattering role made all the more so by the unflattering outfits -- and unflattering situations -- into which arquette is thrust .
then there 's natasha henstridge ( "" species "" i and ii ) who plays the well - to - do wife of contract killer bruce willis .
she gets involved with perry 's character when he comes to chicago hoping to negotiate a finder 's fee with mob boss
yanni gogolack ( kevin pollack , transposing his vs with his ws ) after willis ' jimmy the tulip tudeski moves in next door .
henstridge and perry 's characters hitting it off is about as likely as bruce and demi getting back together .
perry might have the charm but he does n't have the physical attributes of a traditional leading man , especially in close - up .
most objectified of the bunch is amanda peet , who turns in a sexually - ripe performance as perry 's dental assistant with , it transpires , questionable career goals .
peet 's gratuitous nude scene proves how low this movie will stoop to keep its audience from dropping off .
when "" my cousin vinny "" is the highpoint of a directorial career including such forgettable films as "" clue , "" "" greedy , "" and "" sgt . bilko , "" you have to wonder if lynn chose the wrong career path .
perry 's pratfalling goofiness coupled with willis ' likable hardness could have had some potential but with no script to work with , and a director who seems to be watching from the wings , their characters run out of gas quickly .",0,"['proves how low this movie will stoop', 'no script to work with', 'also offensive in so much as its three central female characters are portrayed as nothing more than sex objects', 'its failings go much deeper', 'it is borderline offensive', 'their characters run out of gas quickly']"
"let me just start this review off by saying i am a huge fan of professional wrestling and have been for fifteen years .
i am not too fond of ted turner 's world championship wrestling , however , and i am even less fond of it now after seeing this ridiculous excuse for a wrestling movie tonight .
the plot concerns two losers named gordie boggs ( david arquette , aptly cast as a neandrathal ) and sean dawkins ( scott caan ) who are so obsessed with professional wrestling that they believe everything they see on wcw monday nitro is something more than a flashy show .
when they finally get to see their hero , wcw world champion jimmy king ( played by oliver platt .
i personally would have gotten a wrestler to play king ) , he ends up getting screwed over by evil promoter titus sinclair ( a wasted palitaliano , in a role originally meant for real - life wcw president eric bischoff before he was fired and rehired six months later , and if anyone reads this who knows bischoff , they will agree with me that the role of sinclair had his name written all over it ) , they embark on a quest to find him and help him get his title back .
when they find him , they discover in horror
that jimmy king 's real life is nothing like it is on
wcw tv .
king is a drunken atlanta native rather than an english king .
after convincing king that they do n't care that his persona is n't real , gordie and sean sneak him back onto wcw monday nitro , after which sinclair agrees to book him in a main event steel cage match for the wcw title and his job back in las vegas at wcw 's pay - per - view .
gee , whiz , there are so many things wrong with this movie , i do n't know where to begin .
yes , i do . . .
1 .
the characters of gordie and sean show you what eric bischoff , wcw president who thought up this project , thinks of wrestling fans .
he thinks of us as idiots who take everything wrestlers do seriously .
he actually thinks wrestling fans are dumb enough to believe this is meant to be taken seriously .
i got news for you , eric : nobody above the age of four is dumb enough for that
, this is 2000 , you know , not 1985 !
i know he 'll probably cover arguments up by saying it is n't meant to be taken seriously
but it is , because that 's how big an ego bischoff has .
2 .
there was a documentary made in 1998 , wrestling with shadows , that documented the owner of the world wrestling federation , vince mcmahon 's screwing bret "" the hitman "" hart out of the title .
this movie 's storyline is basically a comic rip - off of that plot with the poor man 's wayne and garth thrown in .
eric bischoff is trying to make vince mcmahon look bad with the character of titus sinclair , but any wrestling fan knows titus is more like bischoff than mcmahon , and that vince did what he had to do to bret hart .
3 .
the movie 's main wrestler , jimmy king , has an english king gimmick and the audience cheered big for him .
no wrestling fan actually enjoys characters like that in this day and age , we want bad asses today !
4 .
why make this a comedy , instead of an emotional , rocky - style drama ?
i know wrestling is n't a sport , but you can still get behind a guy who struggles as a wrestler and finally makes it in the end .
5 .
in the movie , gordie starts up an ill - fated romance with nitro girl sasha ( the lovely rose mcgowan .
what she sees in that freak marilyn manson i 'll never understand ) , only to find that she has hospitalized king 's trainer for sinclair .
would n't it have been easier to just have them fall in love instead of doing the typical spy - girl - for - the - bad - guy cliche ?
i hate that .
6
. last , but certainly not least , there was not one single moment in this movie that i could not predict would happen , nor did i laugh once either .
the world wrestling federation should have been the wrestling company to make the movie , for these reasons :
1 .
they 're the better promotion .
2 .
they have better and younger talent , performers and wrestlers .
3 .
they give their fans what they want and do n't treat them like idiots .
4 .
they 're winning the ratings and they 're the promotion everybody cares about .
5 . simply put , they could make a movie a hundred times better , and they could do a wrestling movie the right way .
the only good thing about this movie was they played outtakes at the end .
and if i spoiled it for you , good , i saved you from wasting seven dollars .",0,"['this ridiculous excuse for a wrestling movie', 'last , but certainly not least , there was not one single moment in this movie that i could not predict would happen , nor did i laugh once either', ""gee , whiz , there are so many things wrong with this movie , i do n't know where to begin . yes , i do . . ."", 'they could make a movie a hundred times better', ""this movie 's storyline is basically a comic rip - off"", ""would n't it have been easier to just have them fall in love instead of doing the typical spy - girl - for - the - bad - guy cliche ? i hate that ."", 'aptly cast', 'i saved you from wasting seven dollars']"

"" and now , "" starship troopers "" director paul verhoeven adds one more image that will live in our memories forever : doogie houser doing a vulcan mind meld with a giant slug .
"" starship troopers , "" loosely based on the robert heinlein novel , is the story of an interstellar war between humans and giant insects .
in the hands of verhoeven , the mammoth sci - fi battle flick is one of the most astonishingly bad films ever made , a monument to inept filmmaking on a colossal scale . to put it simply , it 's a bug bomb .
in "" robocop "" and "" total recall , "" verhoeven displayed a gift for creating an entertaining mix of violence , special effects and social satire , and "" starship troopers "" starts off in similar fashion , with a tongue - in - cheek futuristic military recruitment ad that shows promise .
things go downhill fast , though , as we meet our heroes , a group of buenos aires teens preparing to graduate from high school .
inexplicably , johnny rico , carmen ibenez , dizzy flores and xander barcalow are played by square - jawed anglo kids who look like they just stepped out of a mountain dew commercial .
it 's a veritable "" alpha centuri 90210 "" as we watch the love - smitten teens squabble in the name of love .
michael ironside plays their teacher , who waves around a cheesy fake severed arm while lecturing about civic responsibilities .
eventually , the kids join the military , with dreams of glory in their addled little minds .
one of their classmates , carl jenkins ( "" doogie houser 's "" neil patrick harris , ) snags a job in military intelligence because of his strong psychic abilities .
he displays his gift by psychically ordering a pet ferret to crawl up his mother 's leg .
a long , dull boot camp sequence follows , enlivened only by an extended coed shower scene where the recruits swap snappy banter as the "" showgirls "" director 's camera roams over their buff bodies .
finally , a full hour into the film , the war finally starts and we meet the enemy .
the bugs hail from klendathu and colonize planets by hurling their spores into space .
they attack starships by spinning around and firing deadly plasma blasts from their rears .
yes , incredible as it seems , the bugs actually kill with cosmic farts .
a phenomenally large amount of money was spent creating the computer animated insects and the results are mixed at best .
sweeping distant shots depicting hordes of giant bugs racing to attack are both impressive and scary , but the close - ups are a different matter .
the insects have an odd , artificial look , like origami creations with a mottled plastic coating .
the attack scenes are intensely violent , as one would expect from verhoeven , but the overall look is too phony to generate any real tension .
while the action is frantic , the military strategy , wildly illogical even by hollywood standards ,
grows tiresome quickly .
verhoeven tries to spice things up by throwing in more satiric news coverage , but the faux - jingoistic scenes of children "" doing their part for the war effort "" by squishing roaches on a sidewalk are n't enough to make up for the long stretches of sheer dreck .
one can only guess what paul verhoeven was trying to do here .
his customary one part satire , two parts ultra - violence formula is way out of whack , and most of the film just flounders
.
in "" showgirls "" fashion , some scenes are almost bad enough to be good .
an intergalactic kegger party , with jake busey playing "" dixie "" on a green plexiglas fiddle , has a certain bizarre appeal .
a sex scene between two of the teens achieves a smarmy charm , enhanced a few minutes later when the female receives a fatal jab from a bug , but tells her hero that she does n't mind dying .
""
it 's okay ,
"" she gasps , "" i got to have you !
"" and then , of course , there 's doogie 's mind meld with a bug .
it 's possible that verhoeven was attempting to create an homage to the era of the original novel .
heinlein 's pre- "" stranger in a strange land "" books were aimed at adolescent males , and "" starship troopers "" has the antiseptic retro - future look of late 50s / early 60s sci - fi .
the one cityscape shown is a jetsons - like gleaming metropolis , with flying cars whizzing past an obvious matte painting .
the hairstyles are retro too , straight from the frankie avalon , annette funicello school of fashion .
ultimately , verhoeven 's motives are irrelevant .
he has produce a gargantuan film that fails as an action film or as a social satire .
it even fails to be an entertaining bad movie . avoid "" starship troopers "" at all costs .",0,"['one of the most astonishingly bad films ever made , a monument to inept filmmaking on a colossal scale', 'the results are mixed at best', 'avoid', 'things go downhill fast', 'the overall look is too phony to generate any real tension', 'the long stretches of sheer dreck', 'at all costs .', 'a long , dull', 'wildly illogical', 'it even fails to be an entertaining bad movie', 'a cheesy fake severed arm', 'grows tiresome quickly', 'he has produce a gargantuan film that fails', 'out of whack , and most of the film just flounders']"
"when you go to the movies as much as i do , you unfortunately end up seeing certain movie trailers one too many times .
such was the case with frequency .
every time i went to a screening , there was the frequency preview .
it looked awful .
it looked cheesy , sappy and ridiculous .
it looked like a flop .
well , whoever put that trailer together should be fired , because in terms of pure entertainment , frequency is one of the best of the year thus far .
frequency boasts
a compelling story line .
an occurrence of freakish solar activity allows police detective john sullivan ( james caviezel ) to speak to his fireman father frank sullivan ( dennis quaid ) through a ham radio , despite the fact that frank has been dead for 30 years .
john is able to give his father information that prevents his death in a warehouse fire , but by doing so causes other changes .
somehow , a serial killer 's reign of terror , which in the original timeline had been stopped at three murders , extends to ten victims . . . including john 's mother .
this is director gregory hoblit 's third film ( the other two being primal fear and fallen ) .
with all three , he 's managed to attach himself to great scripts ( this one by toby emmerich , whose only previous movie experience was as a music supervisor on numerous new line films ) and add equally great direction .
also , he apparently likes to have his films wrap up with a kick - ass ending .
frequency is no exception , the ending is unpredictable and incredibly satisfying .
hoblit is three for three , and i hope he can keep it up .
now everyone can argue logic this and logic that all you want with the sci - fi elements of frequency .
but the fact of the matter is that time travel has never been achieved .
who 's to say how something works and how it does n't when it 's never happened ?
is it because we 've become accustomed to time travel "" laws "" from other places like "" star trek "" and the back to the future trilogy and "" quantum leap "" ?
yes , if you sit down and think about it , certain plot elements in this film probably wo n't make any sense .
most films are like that .
do n't let that dissuade you from seeing this fantastically entertaining film however .
when frequency was over , it made me wish i had seen it with my father so i could have given him a hug (
okay okay , shut up ) .
when you break it down past all its sci - fi elements and serial killer antics , frequency is simply a movie about a father and his son and the bond that they share .

"i love movies .
i really do .
every time i watch great movies like goodfellas ( 1990 ) or raiders of the lost ark ( 1981 ) , a tear comes to my eye due to the awesome talent , skill and entertainment that is on display .
even lower grade films such as the naked gun 33 1/3 ( 1994 ) or ghostbusters ii ( 1988 )
while not exactly brilliantly well made , are certainly not a waste of celluloid and present entertainment value .
then there 's my favourite martian , the exact opposite of what a movie should be : a hurried , poorly written and acted movie with one goal , to make money .
disney , ever since the lion king ( 1994 ) have lost their magic touch , but this dross just shows how far disney have sunk
.
christopher lloyd plays a martian who crash lands in front of t .
v reporter 's tim o'hara car ( daniels ) , and soon tim finds the martian in his home , trying to recover and fix his spaceship .
along with his ' zoot ' spacesuit , voiced by wayne knight , must fix his spaceship before it explodes , and also try to stop his identity being revealed to the public , firstly by o'hara , but later by rival t .
v presenter brace channing ( hurley ) , by calling himself tim 's ' uncle martin . '
' laughter ' is supposed to arise from the ' comical ' events , but never does .
many bad films have good intentions , but my favourite martian does n't appear to try to provide any entertainment .
filled to the brim with wham bang special effects , my favourite martian offers little more than some nice eye candy .
christopher lloyd mugs his way through the entire movie
, i 've never seen a man pull a face for 93 minutes until now .
jeff daniels plays ' staple nice guy ' and his role is useless .
his performance is incredibly lazy , although his paperthin character does n't deserve more than the performance he gives .
darryl hannah looks as pretty as ever , but her role is somewhat , erm , limited .
hurley mistakes ' acting ' for ' shouting and looking like a twit ' and wins the david wilcock award for ' most irritating , godawful performance in a moving picture . ' way to go liz !
for the supporting cast , disney manage to assemble every character actor out there , during the film i was going ' he was the guy in .
. .
ah .
. er . . . ' before finally giving up and switching off . another major setback is the staple ' comedy sidekick . '
unfortunately , the writers ( sherri stoner and deanna oliver , if anyone cares ) forget that a comedy sidekick needs to be ' funny . '
instead , they deliver zoot , the martians deeply unfunny sidekick .
although meant to be a manic character
no doubt , every line that comes out of his ' neck ' is a dud .
a real dud .
citizen kane delivers more laughs a minute than his hell spawn piece of polyester .
even the kids in the audience were insulted by this character : not one child even bothered to smirk .
it 's a nice special effect , though .
another problems with this comedy are the gags themselves .
or rather , the lack of them .
my favourite martian reaches a new level of toilet humour : it goes past the bowl , down the pipe and into the sewer .
now , toilet humour can be funny , as dumb and dumber ( 1994 ) humorously showed .
but here , characters farting , belching and almost getting crapped on ( literally ) is not ' amusing . '
it 's insulting .
there 's one good gag right before the credits , but it appears the guy who wrote that gag tragically died and his unfunny twin continued .
either that , or they were hoping that easy to please six year olds would n't mind the fact that his movie is beaten by men at work in the funny stakes .
yes , men at work .
yowza !
the fact that a lot of money was pumped into this film , and that they actually got people to agree to be in this film just depresses me even more .
there are thousands of brilliant films out there
that ca n't get distribution , yet

"the "" fab 4 "" of ronald reagan high are four stuck - up girls , played by rose mcgowan , rebecca gayheart , julie benz and charlotte roldan , who overdress like 4 posh spice wannabes .
their daily ritual is to parade up and down the school halls like royalty , and their constant reflex action is to grab their compacts so they can check their make - up and powder their cheeks .
under no circumstances will they ever let themselves be seen eating in public .
in writer and director darren stein 's jawbreaker , it is n't as funny as it sounds .
in fact , it is n't funny at all .
stein has taken the black comedy of a teen movie like heathers and stripped it of any intelligence , wit or charm .
his actresses toss off their lines so fast that they do n't have time to add any emotion .
and all of his female characters have considerably more lipstick than brains .
the setup for the movie has one of the fab 4 , liz , who is referred to as "" the princess di of reagan high , "" be killed when a prank by the other 3 goes wrong .
the princess di reference is in bad taste , as is much of the movie .
granted , bad taste can sometimes be funny , but the mere presence of bad taste does n't guarantee it .
liz 's girlfriends stick a jawbreaker that is literally larger than a golf ball in her mouth , tape her mouth shut , and stick her bound body in the trunk of a car .
when they open the trunk later , liz is dead .
they eventually put her blue and bruised body into a sexual position and make it look like liz was the victim of a brutal rape .
these realistic and disgusting scenes of a dead , seminude teen have a pornographic feeling that is hard to forget and will likely turn the stomach of many a viewer .
the film 's dialog
not only is n't funny , it 's trite .
one nerdy young girl introduces herself with "" my name is fern mayo , as in hold the mayo .
""
when fern discovers what has happened , the fab 3 make her an offer she ca n't refuse -- make - up !
they cake it on her and welcome her to the clan .
the parents in the movie brag about learning parenting skills from watching oprah .
the teachers fare no better , especially in the ridiculous lines they are given .
"" miss shayne , please cover your bosom , "" one young teacher , who has been made up to look old and ugly , says without any conviction .
""
this is a learning institution , not a brothel .
"" besides the obvious question of why this movie was ever made , there is one other question that i 'd like to ask the director .
why do you have a phone number start with 555 if you going to cover the rest of the number anyway ?
in a cameo , pam grier plays detective vera cruz , who investigates liz 's murder .
as she interrogates the other people , she stares at them like they are all idiots , proving that she is the only one that gets it .
i am sure that if the hard nosed detective cruz were to see this movie , she 'd walk out after about 5 minutes , and you 'd be well advised to do the same if you should happen to find yourself in a theater showing it .
jawbreaker runs 1 : 27 .
it is rated r for violence , gore , profanity and sex .
i would advise everyone to avoid it , but if teenagers go they should be older and mature .",0,"[""stripped it of any intelligence , wit or charm . his actresses toss off their lines so fast that they do n't have time to add any emotion"", ""not only is n't funny , it 's trite"", 'these realistic and disgusting scenes of a dead , seminude teen have a pornographic feeling that is hard to forget and will likely turn the stomach of many a viewer', 'is in bad taste', ""it is n't funny at all"", 'i would advise everyone to avoid it', 'ridiculous lines']"
"robin williams , this time without a beard , returns to drama in this sloppy , sickly sweet fantasy with few redeeming features apart from the incredible effects .
he plays chris nielsen , who meets annie ( annabella sciora ) and promptly marries her .
they have two great kids , who sadly die in a car crash .
just when it could n't get any worse , chris gets killed in a car crash , and goes to heaven where he meets his guide albert ( gooding jnr . )
annie ca n't take the grief anymore , and kills herself .
( all sounding like good fun so far ? )
the ' penalty ' for suicide is to go to hell , and chris goes on a mission to try and rescue her using the help of the traveller ( max von sydow . )
based on a novel by twilight zone writer richard matheson , what dreams may come is clunky , manufactured material doused with a extra load of sugar .
this is the worse spielberg film spielberg never made .
everything is wrong about this movie : the performances are forced , and the audiences fail to relate to any of the characters .
williams puts on a convincing upset face , but that 's all it is : a face .
there 's no emotion behind it .
sciora 's performance is lazy , and bogs down the whole film .
she may look pretty , but she ca n't act .
max von sydow is o .
k as the traveller , if nothing special .
cuba gooding jnr , thankfully , adds some bounce to his performance , and is certainly the best performer in the film .
it 's a shame that his character is so flat and 2-d , and offers no room for improvement .
all the performers have to work with a soppy script
, that tries it 's best to get some emotion going , but never takes off the ground .
there are _ some _ scenes which could be real heartwarmers , but the faceless characters do n't help to get anything out of the performers .
while films like e .
t used great actors , music and direction to pull of a masterful heart - tugging scene , what dreams may come is haphazard , expecting the emotion to come out of the scene automatically .
instead , it 's all rather boring
.
sure , the music is pretty ( by michael kamen ) and the cinematography is n't bad ( by eduardo serra ) but there 's something lacking .
the script does n't help , filled with hopeless romantic clich ?
s , and dud speeches
.
richard matheson can write some awesome science fiction stories , sadly this novel would look embarrassed in a bargain bin , let alone being converted into a $ 70 million vehicle for robin williams . despite being set in heaven , what dreams may come is mightily depressing .
the film rushes a happy ending , but everything before this is very , very sad and black , which just adds to make the ending even more hopeless and stupid
.
but there 's one redeeming feature about this failure of a movie : the special effects .
heaven and hell are truly incredible places , and the actors fit perfectly with the virtual sets .
but despite this , what dreams may come , proves to be nothing but the biggest disappointment of 1998 .
instead of raising questions about existence , it raises boredom .
sadly , i recommend you give this film a miss .
better luck next time , robin .

"` the bachelor ' is one of the best terrible movies you will ever see . wading through
this gooey , detestable sludge is quite the chore for even a dedicated romantic .
those hoping to find some genuine charm and feeling behind this chris o'donnell vehicle should wander elsewhere ; ` the bachelor ' is a painfully clumsy mess strung together with a few brief moments of surprising poignancy . awaiting these moments by enduring the rest of the film is certainly not worth your time or money .
although he has not quite evolved out of the stereotypical pretty - boy cocoon , chris o'donnell has an effortless charm as an actor .
most will recognize him as the high - flying robin from the two latest ` batman ' films , but other abilities are evident behind his boyish smile .
can o'donnell carry the weight of a film on his shoulders ?
perhaps , if he found the proper vehicle . . .
but ` the bachelor ' falls far short of the requirements .
the actor just ca n't register with such a pathetic screenplay as the guiding light to success .
a few instances of adorable humor aside , it becomes apparent that no one could save the festering mess that is ` the bachelor ' .
o'donnell plays jimmie , a hopeless romantic in his late twenties who 's progressing in a serious relationship with anne ( renee zellweger ) .
jimmie takes anne out for dinner to the restaurant specifically used for proposals , and attempts to ask for her hand in marriage .
the problem is that his proposal sucks .
big time .
you can tell things are n't going pleasantly , because jimmie gets the infamous ? deer - in - the - headlights ' look when anne questions his approach .
and then , the plot ( along with the stupidity of the movie ) thickens .
jimmie 's grandfather ( peter ustinov ) dies suddenly , leaving a video will behind for his grandson ( who also happens to be his only living relative ) .
everybody is speechless when grandpa declares that he is passing down an inheritance in the amount of 100 million dollars to jimmie .
of course , there 's a catch : he must get married before his 30th birthday , stay joined with his bride for an entire decade , and produce healthy children within the first five years .
the bad news is that jimmie 's birthday is the following day .
with anne out of town , he must find a willing bride to share his riches with . . .
and within a very limited time frame .
there are certainly a few worthwhile aspects of ` the bachelor ' .
for one , the movie 's approach is interesting and not dripping with clich ? .
another is the colorful cast .
o'donnell and zellweger are cute together , and the supporting cast tries relentlessly to rescue the film from drowning in it 's own mediocrity .
ustinov is enjoyable as the cranky grandfather figure , and james cromwell is sincere and effective as a wise priest dragged through jimmie 's marital adventures .
and now the cons
: the approach may be interesting , but in trying an old - fashioned method , director gary sinyor gives the film a synthetic feel .
the characters are drawn with obvious , broad strokes , and the plot is bogged down with everything humanly imaginable .
yes , ` the bachelor ' is far more frustrating than cute .
the screenplay is lamely written , and the subject matter poorly conceived .
the considerable charm of the two leads is thoughtlessly wasted , along with whatever promise the film initially contained .
potential goes out the window early to suit sinyor 's ` colorful ' approach , but not a minute of this hapless drivel seems accustomed to the director 's wishes .
` the bachelor ' becomes lost without a homing beacon to save it .
you 've seen the tv spots , have n't you ?
o'donnell is madly rushing down a deserted street and the caption reads ` what is this man running from ? ' in actuality , he 's fleeing from thousands of angry brides who want to marry him and inherit his fortune ( it 's one of the few enjoyable sequences in the film ) .
after seeing the movie , i believe that the approaching horde could be something else .
o'donnell could be running from his angry fans , who have just endured ` the bachelor ' , and are hunting him down for revenge .",0,"['potential goes out the window early', 'a painfully clumsy mess', 'such a pathetic screenplay', 'falls far short', 'the stupidity of the movie', 'not a minute of this hapless drivel', 'poorly conceived', 'an old - fashioned method , director gary sinyor gives the film a synthetic feel . the characters are drawn with obvious , broad strokes , and the plot is bogged down with everything humanly imaginable', 'lamely written', 'far more frustrating', 'one could save the festering mess', 'awaiting these moments by enduring the rest of the film is certainly not worth your time or money', 'thoughtlessly wasted', 'this gooey , detestable sludge is quite the chore', 'becomes lost without a homing beacon to save it']"
"sydney lumet is the director whose work happens to be of varied quality .
he is praised for some of the most important films of the previous decades , like twelve angry men , serpico or the verdict .
but , in the same time , almost any of such pearls is followed by stinkers
that hamper lumet 's reputation .
a stranger among us , 1992 rip - off of peter weir 's witness , belongs to the latter category .
the heroine of this movie is emily eden ( melanie griffith ) , tough lady cop who sometimes shows too much enthusiasm in battling bad guys on the streets of new york .
during one of such actions , her partner nick ( jamey sheridan ) got hurt and as a result , she becomes depressed .
in order to help her recover , bosses give her rather easy task of locating missing jeweller who belonged to hassidic jew community .
emily starts investigation and soon realises that the case involves murder .
concluding that the perpetrator belongs to community , she decides to go undercover .
that is n't easy , because her modern manners are colliding with traditionalist ways .
things get even more complicated when she develops feelings for young cabalistic scholar ariel ( eric thal ) . using peter weir 's formula is n't the greatest flaw of this film .
even the lame and unispiring crime mystery subplot works to the certain extent .
but the worst insult
to viewer 's audience is terrible miscasting of melanie griffith .
the author of this review never liked this actress very much , but she was at least tolerable in some of her roles .
role of emily eden , unfortunately , is n't one of them .
first of all , she ca n't pass for tough nypd street fighter , and her attempt to pass for orthodox jewish woman is n't much better .
screenplay by robert j .
avrech makes things even worse with some formulaic red herring subplots ( scene involving two italian gangsters was almost too painful to watch ) .
but , on the other hand , other actors are more convincing ( lee richardson as an old rabbi , thal as ariel and charming mia sara as his intended bride ) , and the photography by andrzej bartkowiak very effectively creates atmosphere of warmth when the scenes take place in hassidic community .
also , the film might educate viewers about hassidic culture .
that is the only thing that prevents it from turning into total waste of time .",0,"['lame and unispiring crime mystery subplot', 'rip - off', 'stinkers', 'belongs to the latter category', 'the worst insult', 'total waste of time', 'terrible miscasting']"
"when robert forster found himself famous again after appearing in "" jackie brown "" , he immediately signed up for a little film called "" american perfekt "" .
this was almost two years ago .
i waited patiently for the film to be released , but it never was .
finally , i forgot about it .
the other day , though , while i was perusing the selection of the local video store , i stumbled upon , you guessed it , "" american perfekt "" .
i immediately rented it and with a certain amount of glee , rushed home to view it .
having now seen the film , i understand why it never saw theatrical release .
"" american perfekt "" is a jumbled mess .
the storyline is non - existent .
it took me half the movie just to figure out what was going on
.
and at that point , the only thing i really knew for sure was that the movie was * never * going to introduce a plot of some sort .
it wants to get by on quirkyness and so - called charm alone , and it just does n't work .
robert forster plays a psychiatrist who picks up amanda plummer , and they head off on the road together .
along the way to no discernable destination , they run into all sorts of kooky and wacky characters .
i suppose this free - wheeling , no plot style is supposed to give the film an element of danger and excitment , but all it did was make me sleepy .
i 'm all for trying new things within the realm of film , but not at the expense of coherence .
nothing in this movie makes sense .
the actions of the characters go unexplained , even when they 're truly bizarre .
i 'll give you an example , without giving too much away .
david thewlis has a part as a drifting con - man .
at one point , mid - way through the movie , he runs forster and plummer off the road with his car .
as he passes them , we see that his face is covered in blood .
do you think we would get an explanation as to what happened to him ?
you would think so , would n't you .
"" american perfekt "" is a waste of time .
nothing is gained from watching this movie , except maybe a migraine .

"clue is an unfairly ignored comedy , very similar to 1976 's murder by death .
this big screen version of the classic board game ( what 's next . . .
chutes and ladders : the motion picture ? ) is filled with slapstick antics and silly dialogue .
the plot , for what it 's worth , has all the characters from the game ( in this case , the names from the game are used as aliases ) meeting in an isolated mansion to confront mr .
boddy ( lee ving ) , the man who 's been blackmailing them all .
when he turns up dead , everyone ( including the audience ) must figure out whodunnit . . .
and in what room , and with what object .
while not as witty as neil simon 's murder by death , clue definitely has it moments .
it has so many moments in fact that i use a lot of the lines from the film when i 'm joking around with my friends .
to this day , whenever someone says the phrase "" well , to make a long story short "" i have the follow up phrase "" too late "" ready to go .
the cast ( all very good comedic talents ) play well off one another , while the late madeline kahn ( as the dark and sultry mrs .
white )
sometimes steals the film away from the rest . and colleen camp , as the french maid yvette , displays some of her natural talents as well .
clue is available on dvd from paramount home video .
it includes the film in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 . 85 : 1 ( and is enhanced for 16x9 televisions ) and features the original theatrical trailer .
a french language audio track is also available .
the trailer holds up well considering most previews from that time do not , and it even includes a scene not in the film itself ( a scene that should have been in the film , as it 's a good joke ) .
also , the trailer is scored to the music from airplane !
, which was an interesting choice .
when clue played in theaters , it ran with the gimmick of three different endings . if you wanted to see all three , you had to go to the movies three separate times .
so when the film was released on home video , rather than releasing three separate videos , all three endings were included on one tape . . .
the first two endings being "" what if ? "" endings and the third ending being the actual ending .
now for the dvd release you get two choices .
you can watch the film as it was presented on home video or you can select to watch it with one of the three endings randomly chosen for you .
( note : there 's an easter egg hidden in the disc pertaining to this .
after watching the film with a randomly selected ending , when you return to the menu screen you will be able to highlight the large magnifying glass and select it .
when you do , a secret menu opens , allowing you to watch any of the three endings by themselves . )
now while i applaud the effort of paramount here , as they clearly tried to do something special with the disc , it just does n't work well .
first , why not give the viewer the choice of what ending we want to watch ?
maybe someone like myself who 's seen the movie hundreds of times would like to sit down and show it to someone with the second ending only .
i 'm no technical dvd expert , but i ca n't imagine that being too hard to accomplish .
secondly , the delay between when the film itself ends and one of the endings begins is too long and too obvious , thereby becoming a distraction right when you definitely do n't need a distraction .
finally , the back of the dvd case states "" and now , with this special dvd version , you can see all 3 surprise endings "" .
i have no idea why they would word it that way , since that 's not a special feature in the slightest .
the video has been out for fifteen years now (
good lord , has it been that long ? )
and it 's played on television with all three endings all the time .
these are merely minor complaints however , seeing that i 've watched the home video version hundreds of times and have no problem watching the film as such on the dvd .
the picture and sound are wonderfully improved over my worn out vhs copy , and
i 'm thrilled that paramount agrees with me that clue is a film worthy of being preserved on this great digital format .

"full metal jacket , very much like every other hard - hitting film about the vietnam war , is an shocking , emotional depiction of the war that effected almost everyone in america .
this film is more like platoon than any other in the way that it chronicles the struggles of a young man ( private joker , played by matthew modine ) during his tour in the vietnam war .
however , full metal jacket gives the audience an insight into combat life very rarely seen before : boot camp .
these sequences are considered to be the best part in this three act film , even though i found the later portions to be equally stunning .
as in platoon , full metal jacket gets off to a quick start .
the opening sequence is the initiation for the recruits , which is getting their heads shaved .
from there , they find themselves standing at attention and receiving their orders from the extremely hard and punishing sergeant hartman , played extremely well by the former drill instructor r .
lee ermey .
apparently , the solution was found for the perfect man to play a drill instructor in the movies , because ermey depicts his character extremely well and will make you thank whomever that you were never subjected to such horrible situations .
private joker gets off on the wrong foot with the sergeant , as does the large bodied private leonard lawrence ( vincent d'onofrio ) , whom is dubbed ' gomer pyle ' by sgt . hartman .
the film is continually narrated by private joker , in which he explains his visions on what is going on .
the entire corps , although repeatedly hammered by sgt .
hartman , continues on .
private pyle , however , seems to be the rag doll for the drill instructor .
he continually absorbs the worst punishment and humiliation , and it basically does not stop .
that is , until sgt .
hartman comes up with a new plan .
he will punish the rest of the soon - to - be - marines for pyle 's goof - ups , even after joker was assigned to help him out in the best way he can .
pyle then receives punishment from his fellow recruits , and things take a turn for the worst .
pyle proves that not everyone is emotionally , physically , and mentally cut out for the life of a marine .
after graduation , joker is sent over to the height of the action in order to document the war , which is his service .
he is not a member of the infantry , and it is unclear if he will ever actually find himself in combat .
when he sets out on a documenting mission , this question becomes very clear from the start .
joker joins up with a platoon , along with his hometown friend cowboy ( arliss howard ) , and follows their everyday actions , interviewing and filmming them along the way .
he also soon finds himself in a position in which he must fight , or die .
again , as in the tradition of vietnam war films , full metal jacket can be debated as to whether it is an anti - war film or not .
a few of the more powerful scenes toward the end will leave you to decide .
full metal jacket succeeds extremely well in documenting the life of a young man in vietnam , as have others in the past .
this film , in different ways , also can be viewed as more powerful than others .
that , again , is up for debate and depends on your opinion .
one thing is for sure , however ; no one ever wants to experience the absolute hell that these soldiers are subjected to .
unfortunately , many did .",1,"['can be viewed as more powerful than others', 'succeeds extremely well', 'equally stunning', 'a few of the more powerful scenes', 'these sequences are considered to be the best part']"
"susan granger 's review of "" ghosts of mars "" ( sony pictures entertainment ) horror auteur john carpenter ( "" halloween , "" "" vampires "" ) strikes out with this sci - fi eco - fable
that 's so bad it boggles the mind to imagine how the project ever got green - lit
.
the script by carpenter and larry sulkis appears to have been lifted directly from last year 's "" pitch black , "" involving a violent prisoner who must be released from bondage so that he can help a small band of humans protect themselves from blood - thirsty , marauding aliens .
in the year 2176 , there are 640 , 000 earthlings on mars , living in a matriarchal society led by a commander , played by pam grier .
grier , pill - poppin ' natasha henstridge , and some rookie mars police officers ( clea duvall , jason statham ) travel to the remote mining town of shining canyon to fetch "" desolation "" williams -
that 's ice cube - to bring him back to chryse city to stand trial for murder .
but when they 're besieged by demented , zombie - like , body - snatching miners , they readily free the scowling ice cube since they need him for protection .
it seems a red cloud was released from a shining canyon cave and , soon after , most of the miners went bonkers as long - dormant remnants of an ancient martian civilization took over their minds and bodies , lopping off heads as "" vengeance for anything that tries to lay claim to their planet , "" according to a scientist ( joanna cassidy ) .
carpenter uses so many flashbacks to tell the "" night of the living dead
"" -like story that the idiotic plot gets incomprehensibly confusing .
but you can easily predict each of the supporting characters who will be killed , along with the order of their elimination .

"movies about teenagers and teenage culture rarely prove to be either interesting , entertaining or convincing , because of one fundamental reason : movies are made by adults and not teenagers .
occasionally , however , films like say anything , dazed and confused and the breakfast club will break the mold and offer genuine insight into the lives of those bizarre creatures which surround us called "" teenagers .
""
ca n't hardly wait , however , does not .
instead , the writing / directing team of harry elfont and deborah kaplan manages to take every clich ?
found in the teenage genre , strip it completely of perception , intelligence and wit - and turn it into one of the most nauseating cinematic experiences i have ever been subjected to .
ca n't hardly wait follows a group of characters as they attend a house party on the night of their high school graduation .
the main characters are such perfected stereotypes that no analysis needs to be provided to perfectly understand them : there 's the average male protagonist preston ( ethan embry ) , prom queen and cheerleader amanda ( jennifer love - hewitt ) , football star mike ( peter facinelli ) , white rapper wannabe kenny ( seth green ) , computer geek william ( charlie korsmo ) , and brainy outsider denise ( lauren ambrose ) .
i could n't stand any of those characters .
whether it was william getting drunk and signing along to heavy metal songs or kenny proclaiming "" yo , i got ta have sex tonight ! "" , all i could think of was how elfont and kaplan possibly managed to con columbia pictures out of ten million dollars to fund their film .
apparently , ca n't hardly wait is supposed to be a comedy , but it tends to fail in this respect because of the fact that it 's not funny
.
in all honesty , elfont and kaplan should be forced by their employers to attend remedial classes in humour .
and when i say "" forced "" , i mean it .
they should be strapped down to a chair and have their eyes wedged open in a similar fashion to alex in a clockwork orange .
this is how desperately they need to be educated about the concept of humour .
for instance , ca n't hardly wait features a foreign exchange student who is instructed to repeat absurd statements such as "" i am a sex machine .
"" for some reason , elfont and kaplan believe that if this character repeats it enough , eventually it will be funny .
if only elfont and kaplan could recognise the irony that they actually got paid for making this junk - now that 's funny .",0,"['manages to take every clich ? found in the teenage genre , strip it completely of perception , intelligence and wit - and turn it into one of the most nauseating cinematic experiences i have ever been subjected to', ""it 's not funny"", ""i could n't stand any of those characters""]"
"just in time for halloween and christmas , the reissue of the nightmare before christmas could n't be more appropriate .
with all of the attention thrown to "" family films "" in recent years , namely those starring pocket monsters and nickelodeon characters , it 's high time
we raised the intellectual level of children 's fare as well as the animation achievements of the movie studios .
with that in mind , it was refreshing to revisit an animation classic on the big screen that still retains the originality and freshness
it had seven years ago .
nightmare is the story of one man 's quest to discover his true purpose in life -- to look beyond the accolades of his peers , the achievements of his years , and the praise of his ego .
jack skellington , the pumpkin king of halloweentown , is the main dude behind the halloween holiday for kids everywhere .
but during his reign as pumpkin king , jack has somehow lost his understanding of his place in the world and the magic he creates with his halloween holiday .
after the completion of one particular halloween season , jack walks with a heavy heart and ends up discovering in the woods outside halloweentown a grove of trees with doors to all of the other holidays in the world .
imagine his surprise to discover christmastown , a far more impressive and uplifting holiday than halloween , surrounded by happy elves making toys , and with good cheer all around .
upon his return to halloweentown , jack decides to combine halloween and christmas together by kidnapping "" sandy claws , "" employing all the residents of halloweentown to build toys for children .
he then aims to take over the role as primary joy - provider and gift - bearer to the children of the world , in the hopes of rediscovering the zest for life he once had .
alas , the co - mingling of halloween and christmas creates disastrous results involving shrunken heads , psychotic wooden ducks , a sleigh pulled by a phantom dog with a lighted nose , and a large , sinister , singing bag named oogie boogie tim burton -- the man behind such great films as ed wood , beetlejuice , pee - wee 's big adventure , and edward scissorhands -- is the creative force behind nightmare .
originally , burton authored a poem that became the basis of the storyline , and he was jointly involved in the production design of the film ( though many mistakenly assume he directed the picture ) .
the stamp of burton is clearly everywhere in the film -- with bold colors , imaginative character design , and it 's simple yet compelling story .
the direction of harry selick , who also directed james and the giant peach , is strong , offering intimate views of the strange collection of characters .
also memorable are the songs in the film , written by former oingo boingo lead singer danny elfman , the next john williams of film composing .
the nightmare before christmas is intended for both the kid and adult in everyone .
it 's not just child 's play for the holidays ; it 's a movie about how to be truly happy in a tough world , saying that all you need to do is just be exactly who you are , without compromise .
what better message is there for christmas ?",1,"['strong , offering intimate views', ""we raised the intellectual level of children 's fare as well as the animation achievements"", ""bold colors , imaginative character design , and it 's simple yet compelling"", 'it was refreshing to revisit an animation classic on the big screen that still retains the originality and freshness', 'the creative force', 'what better message is there for christmas ?', 'memorable']"
"whew .
this film oozes energy , the kind of breakneck ,
no-
holds - barred , in - your - face risk - taking filmmaking that is seldom seen on screen these days .
like the marginal , motley bunch of post - apocalyptic youths director danny boyle tries to depict , trainspotting veers on the edge of utter mayhem but ultimately retains its footing and control . the result : a movie that is a delightful example of how the medium is the message .
the message : a bunch of losers with loser names , mark renton ( ewan mcgregor ) , spud ( ewan bremner ) , sick boy ( jonny lee miller ) , tommy ( kevin mckidd ) , and begbie ( robert carlyle ) .
bored , aimless and restless , their routine consists of getting drunk at the local pub , grooving to techno or glam - rock at the local disco and getting shots up the arm at the local den and procuring cash through a variety of methods , some ingenious , others plainly dumb and desperate .
not part of the daily dose if obtained , sex is a bonus .
you can find these characters as they are , foul - mouthed , dirty , pathetic , ugly perhaps but definitely interesting , in irvin welsh 's cult novel of the same name .
what makes the film a completely different experience is how director boyle uses every tool at his disposal to make the filmic medium synchronous with the message .
one of the first things you 'll notice is how the camera seems to dart around restlessly .
it 'll truck into a character 's pimple , just as soon as it will dolly out to an establishing shot .
distracted and curious , it 'll maintain a character 's eye - level or drop right to the ground to show the doped - out - eye - view .
you 'll even find characters peering into the camera , their faces smeared across the wide - angle lens .
this film camera is just another one of the guys .
tiptoeing that indistinguishable line between fantasy and reality , boyle employs a healthy dose of surrealism to get the message across .
bored kids daydream and bored kids deprived of a heroin fix have nightmares .
i do n't want to give too much away , but if you cross chuckie from child 's play with some of the wacky fantasies in heavenly creatures , you might have an idea
just how fun or pants - wetting scary the alternate state of consciouness can be .
that said , this film has a good share of drugs - consumed , vomitted , defecated , pissed off , exchanged , bought , sold , injected , smuggled , enjoyed and regretted .
if that is n't your cup of tea , nobody forced you to see the film .
stay at home and rent up close and personal .
and what 's a buzz without tunes .
from pulp to iggy pop ( yes , he 's still alive ) ,
the aural landscape is as engaging as the visual energy permeating
the film .
good and bad vibrations tangle like the conflicting desires and values of the message .
every once in a while , a film comes along with the kind of energetic filmmaking that matches the intensity of its characters it hopes to depict .
trainspotting is that shooting star that burns across a sky littered with static constellations .
dom is a part - time filmmaker who graduated from northwestern university 's radio / tv / film programme not too long ago .
he has laboured on various music videos and short films in and around campus and chicago .
nowhere town , a 26min short film that he shot , co - directed and co - produced recently scooped up the grand jury prize at the charleston international film festival for best student production .

if there 's a beast in men , it meets its match in women , too .
"" starring sarah patterson , angela lansbury , tusse silberg , david warner directed by neil jordan written by jordan and angela carter , from a story by carter cinematography by bryan loftus in recent years , there has been a trend in the field of fantasy : writers have been revisiting the fertile world of myth and fairy tale and reclaiming that world , investing it with new life and energy .
in modern times , fairy tales have become disneyfied and debased ; they have become trite adventures involving leering witches , friendly dwarves , and cuddly talking animals .
but in their original forms , fairy tales have a dark , wicked edge .
crows tear out the eyes of cinderella 's sisters , a gorier fate then they receive in the animated version .
hansel and gretel relish cooking the witch in her own oven .
writers have become fascinated by the bloodier , morally ambivalent aspects of fairy tales , and are now modernizing the old stories while simultaneously going back to their roots .
before this trend was in vogue , angela carter -- whose stories always have a dark , wicked , subversive edge -- had been reinventing fairy tales for years .
in the company of wolves , she and neil jordan retell the story of red riding hood , enlivening it with werewolves , rolls royces , and a visit from satan .
the story is structured as a dream , occurring in the mind of rosaleen ( sarah patterson ) , an adolescent girl about whose ' real ' life we learn very little .
within the dream , there are a number of inset stories , most told by dream - rosaleen 's grandmother ( angela lansbury ) , and these tales gloss the central story in intriguing , suggestive ways .
the result is a surprisingly successful example of a sinister , contemporary fairy tale .
i say "" surprisingly "" because there are so many ways this film could have gone wrong .
and there are ways in which it does .
the performances are mediocre , except for lansbury's --
she finds the right note for the prim
, apple - cheeked granny , the wise and stern teller of cautionary tales .
the soundtrack , synth - heavy , reminded me of bad 80s horror movies , as did the special effects in the shapechanging scenes .
probably state - of - the - art at the time
, they are now laughable .
but jordan succeeds at what i consider the trickiest aspect of the film : he transcends the poor acting / music / effects and conveys a sense of the fantastic , of otherness .
one of the problems in adapting full - blown fantasies is that fantasy is often best left to the imagination of the reader , rather than being subjected to the ' realism ' of the screen .
part of me would love to see an adaptation of ' the lord of the rings , ' but , on the other hand , i know that any filmmaker 's recreation of ents , hobbits , and balrogs is inevitably going to be really lame compared to what i picture in my mind .
this makes jordan 's accomplishment here seem mighty impressive to me : he imbues the company of wolves with a genuine sense of magic and mystery .
the somewhat ruritanian dreamworld becomes a kind of ur - reality .
the sunshine is exceptionally warm and abundant .
the nights are quiet and misty and eerie and ghostly .
the peasant village is rustic and cozy , the woods old and hoary .
this archetypal realm is the setting for a smart , subtle , literate script , a script which is as good as you 'd expect from jordan ( himself an accomplished fiction writer ) and carter . for carter , the cauldron of story is a witches ' brew , bubbling over with primal ingredients : mist - shrouded forests , ancient graveyards , virginal girls and wise women , wolves with glowing eyes .
she adeptly blends them all together .
there is a symbolic richness to the film ; everything is permeated with a sense of significance .
the point of it all , i think , is to represent a girl 's rites - of - passage on an unconscious , primordial level .
a night - journey through the forest , from the village to the grandmother 's home , is the crux of the company of wolves .
"" do n't stray from the path , "" rosaleen is told , again and again , and the path is both literal and figurative : the path through the forest and the path of life .
staying on the path is the conventional approach suggested by rosaleen 's elders .
carter and jordan , never conventional , explore what goes on when you leave the path .
those who stray will supposedly meet with a dark fate .
this fate is literalized in the dream as werewolves , but the werewolves connote many things : death , sex , knowledge .
if straying from the path leads to death , then it 's not a good idea -- but if that 's what you have to risk to get sex and knowledge ( and therefore power ) , then maybe it 's worth the risk .
when you leave the path , the world becomes a dangerous , ambiguous place , but it 's full of potential .
and it 's certainly more interesting than the disney version .",1,"['accomplishment here seem mighty impressive', 'a genuine sense of magic and mystery', 'finds the right note', ""a smart , subtle , literate script , a script which is as good as you 'd expect"", 'the result is a surprisingly successful example', ""it 's certainly more interesting"", 'succeeds at what i consider the trickiest aspect of the film : he transcends the poor acting / music / effects and conveys a sense of the fantastic , of otherness']"
"renown surrealist director , the 77-year - old frenchman alain resnais ( hiroshima , mon amour / last year at marienbad / m ? lo ) , has created a lighthearted musical played as an homage to britisher dennis potter and his pennies from heaven ( 1978 tv serial , 1981 movie ) and the singing detective ( 1986 ) .
the film follows potter 's gimmicky style of having the characters jump into lip - synched old or contemporary french pop songs to express their private thoughts .
he also follows the kind of sweet and colorful musicals his fellow countryman jacques demy loved to direct , such as "" the umbrellas of cherbourg "" and "" the young girls of rochefort .
""
the tale has resnais 's unique touches as a director to go along with his homage .
it is a satire about class differences and falling in love with the wrong person , and that there is a song in everyone 's heart for every occasion .
what hinders this production is that the stars are not portraying particularly engaging characters , the songs are not memorable and stand little chance of being recognized by an american audience ( the exceptions might be the edith piaf and maurice chevalier numbers ) , and the farce seems more banal than daring .
yet it is not without its striking moments and charms , such as when jane birkin does a cameo and sings one of her own songs .
also , the glossy amberlike photography added a very french romantic feeling to the story , while the mood of paris as being a place for love to flourish above all else , which has always been embellished in movie lore , comes through with flying colors .
it also does a good job of showing you the way paris is in the 1990s and in the way ordinary people exist there .
it tells the romantic story of six parisians who become intertwined with each other in their ordinary lives as they search for happiness .
they are
the attractive sisters odile ( sabine az ?
ma )
and camille ( agnes jaoui ) , with the older businesswoman odile married and decidedly set on a bourgeois life of material comforts .
she is married to the glum and laconic claude ( pierre arditi ) .
she once went out with a businessman , nicolas ( jean - pierre bacri ) , who left her 8-years ago and now shows up in paris and asks her help to find someone to rent a flat for his family .
simon ( andre dussolier ) works as a real - estate salesman and is trying to find nicolas a flat , in his spare time he writes radio plays .
simon 's boss is the much younger , unscrupulous and arrogant marc duveyrier ( lambert wilson ) , who inherited the firm from his father and is the real - estate agent selling a more luxurious and larger flat with a better view to odile , but fails to tell her that a building project is going up soon that will block her view .
screenwriters and actors jean - pierre bacri and agnes jaoui wrote themselves the best parts .
jaoui 's camille is a university scholar finishing up a ph .
d . in history , using for her thesis the study of ' the yeomen in the year 1000 at lake paladru . '
she works as a tour guide in the meantime and suffers from panic attacks , even though she appears to have outwardly perfect self - control .
on her tours for the last four years has been the much older simon , pretending to be doing research for his plays but really attracted to her , but not having the nerve to tell her this .
to his dismay , he finds out she is dating his mean - spirited but handsome boss , whom she meets when looking at her sister 's new place and seeing him crying but not realizing that it was from a cold , not because he 's so sensitive .
bacri as the classy nicolas , turns out to be now working as a chauffeur .
he is a hypochondriac with a history of depression who visits many doctors , until he finds one who tells him there is nothing wrong with him .
odile still pines for him , but he 's married , telling her he expects his wife to arrive shortly .
love is ' the same old song ' that makes the world go ' round , even when all the characters are liars and not exactly open to what their true motives are .
everything comes together in a bourgeois housewarming party for odile 's place , as the characters reveal their true feelings and all their deceptions and neurotic impulses are either uncovered or about to be .
there 's not a lot of bite to this satirical musical , but resnais has never made a bad film and is one of the best current french directors , if not the best .
this film is not one his great ones , but it still has enough pep in its light touches to be interesting .
it not only has an odd way for the characters to break into song
but -- some males even sing in a female voice while some females sing in a male voice .
it is also interesting in the way it examines its characters ' behavior as being similar in business as in love .",1,"['striking moments and charms', 'does a good job', 'it is also interesting', 'one of the best current french directors , if not the best']"
"that thing you do !
( r ) tom hanks 's screenwriting and directorial debut ,
that thing you do !
, has all the qualities you would associate with the most beloved screen actor of the moment : fun , lively , and oh - so - nice .
it is the latter quality , however , that becomes a hindrance , for this ' 60s nostalgia trifle is so nice and sweet that it teeters on becoming bland milquetoast .
that thing focuses on the wonders , a teen rock band from erie , pennsylvania that is suddenly thrust into the national spotlight in 1964 when they score a major dance hit called , of course , "" that thing you do !
""
the group 's members are , naturally a diverse group : there 's brooding lead singer and songwriter jimmy ( johnathon schaech ) ; girl - crazy lenny ( steve zahn ) , the lead guitarist ; a goofy , geeky type known only as the bass player ( ethan embry ) ; and the film 's center , guy ( tom everett scott ) , the drummer who has aspirations in jazz .
along for the wonders ' ride to success is jimmy 's perpetually neglected galpal , faye ( liv tyler ) .
hanks proves to be a capable writer - director , deftly recreating the innocent spirit of 1964 , which hanks calls "" the last innocent year .
""
the spirit is not only reflected in the period clothes and settings but also in the music , which , like the other recent period music film , grace of my heart , was expressly written for the film ; hanks himself had a hand in writing four of the tunes -- but not the infectious title cut by adam schlesinger , which is guaranteed to stay in your head long after the end credits have rolled ( it 's still playing in my mind as i write this ) .
it should come as no surprise that hanks the director works well with the actors , eliciting charming , likable work from the entire cast , most notably hanks lookalike scott and tyler , who is remarkable in delivering the film 's biggest and best dramatic moment .
the work of the young ensemble is so natural that they truly convince as teens of the early ' 60s ; they do not appear to be ' 90s grungers playacting "" retro .
"" yet for all the light , frothy charms of that thing you do ! , it 's nearly nice to a fault .
while this unbridled innocence in film is a refreshing change from all the sinful cinema around these days , there is not enough conflict to keep things consistently interesting .
everyone is so happy , basking in the glow of overnight success , marvelling at it all -- except toward the end , but even then the tone quickly reverts to sweetness , ending on an appropriately feel - good note .
there is n't much of an edge throughout that thing --
the only thing that is remotely edgy is hanks 's turn as the wonders ' manager -- and thus becomes in danger of being so nice
it 's bland .
but a little niceness goes a long way these days , and
there 's no denying the entertainment value of that thing you do ! ; it 's just about impossible to hate .
it 's an inoffensive , enjoyable piece of nostalgia that is sure to leave audiences smiling and humming , if not singing ,
"" that thing you do !
""
--quite possibly for days .
to paraphrase a passage from the song : though i try and try to forget that song it is just so hard to do every time they play

"a hotshot lawyer gets an obviously guilty child molester acquitted , and shortly after during the victory celebration gets offered an opportunity to show his prowess in new york city .
the lawyer , kevin lomax ( keanu reeves ) is not offered a job yet , he is asked to simply pick a jury .
he accepts .
the jury he selects work out well and before long he is offered a job with the firm .
making his decision easy is the fact that not only is he offered big money , but a gorgeous apartment .
he convinces his wife , mary ann ( charlize theron ) to make the move to new york .
the first case given to him is a big test ; a "" winless "" case concerning a man who sacrifices animals in his basement .
the charge was health code violations and kevin once again shows his skill and earns an acquittal .
his new boss and partner in the firm , john milton ( al pacino ) is quite impressed and takes kevin under his wing , explaining many of his philosophies on law , women and sex , and angles the promise of a blissful , wealthy life .
kevin 's next case is a dream case , given to him by milton himself ( much to the chagrin to his colleagues ) , defending a triple murder suspect who has had a history of problems with the law .
although kevin 's career is taking off , his home life is not doing very well .
mary ann is starting to have numerous problems .
she is experiencing severe depression over kevin 's long hours , and before long is having horrible dreams and hallucinations of people turning into ghouls , their faces becoming horribly disfigured .
kevin does not help matters by dismissing his wife .
he does not spend more time with her as he explains to milton that he needs to spend as much time on the case as possible to get it over with , then focus all of his attention on his wife .
not helping matters is the fact that kevin is having ideas about a possible affair with a sexy lawyer ( connie nielson ) also working with the firm .
mary ann falls deeper into her madness as kevin spends more time away from home .
kevin eventually looses control of his life and has to institutionalize his wife , and gets disturbing news from his mother ( judith ivey ) about the mystery concerning the identity of his father .
he also starts to lose control of his case .
kevin learns that all of his problems have been caused by the work of one man .
that man is his boss , mr .
milton , a truly evil character who just may be the devil himself .
kevin must somehow confront milton and thwart whatever diabolical plan he has in store .
but how do you defeat the devil ?
why is it that most courtroom scenes in the movies are absurd
?
do filmmakers really believe that "" normal "" courtroom drama does n't fit the bill and they have to juice them up ?
the courtroom scenes in this movie would never happen in a real courtroom , which would n't have been too bad if it were n't keanu reeves trying to pull it off .
i give reeves credit for trying hard , but throughout the movie i never saw the kevin lomax character , just an actor trying very hard to play kevin lomax and coming up short .
charlize theron defines the term
"" over - the - top "" in her performance as mary ann lomax , a disappointment in contrast to her good performance in "" 2 days in the valley "" .
the only good performance in the movie is by al pacino , but
i kept asking myself what the heck he was doing in this mess ?
maybe he felt it would be interesting playing the devil , and you can tell he is having fun doing so , but his skill as an actor can not save the poor performances and lackluster script
that surround him .
it 's pretty standard stuff , including the fact that the hotshot lawyer appears to be the only competent person on the planet who can do anything right in the courtroom .
please read no further if you do not want the ending spoiled , but i have to get something off of my chest .
in 1986 i remember watching a movie called "" wisdom "" with emilio estevez and demi moore , and the ending of that film did the worst possible thing that a movie could do .
what i like to call "" guess what , it was all a dream "" scenario .
in "" wisdom "" the two lead characters are killed at the end , only to have one of the characters "" wake up "" from an apparent and say "" gosh , i 'm glad that did n't really happen ! "" .
i considered it inexcusable the way the audience was toyed with
.
well , the same thing happens in "" the devils advocate "" , and although arguments could be made surrounding whether it was actually a dream ( perhaps milton went back in time to try a different route for his plan , since it failed
and he is the devil ) , but the point is that the last 90 % of the film did n't happen .
i know it 's a stretch , after all it is a movie and nothing really happened , but i just get annoyed to get toyed with like that .
of course , the dream ending could almost be forgiven if the story that precedes it was at least an interesting one .
as i recall , "" wisdom "" was a decent film .
""
the devil 's advocate "" is not .

"plunkett & macleane is a period piece mired down by modern mtv pretentions .
i have nothing against the mtv approach to filmmaking -- used properly it can save a movie ( see stigmata ) -- but
it ruins this one , making a muddled , incoherent mess out of a potentially interesting premise .
there are certain genres that just do n't go together .
the film opens with a sequence that i still do n't understand .
it involves some sort of prison outbreak , a robbery , and a gem that keeps being eaten .
in any case , the caper ( whatever it may be ) brings together plunkett and macleane ( robert carlyle and johnny lee miller , respectively ) , two happy - go - lucky brits with no way to make a living .
they make a pact to steal money from the rich and give it to themselves until they earn enough money to buy a ticket to america .
their first heist involves a young debutante named lady rebecca ( liv tyler ) ; a woman macleane was especially friendly with at a party just earlier .
his decorum when stripping her of her valuables earns our two crooks the name "" gentleman highwaymen .
"" lady rebecca also happens to be the niece of the lord chief justice , a glaringly arrogant man nearing the end of his political career .
he demands that the robbers be caught and punished immediately , leaving the job in the hands of the devious chance ( ken stott ) who has a few more things on his mind than catching criminals .
meanwhile , macleane falls in love with rebecca infuriating the businesslike plunkett , who does n't want his plans to be foiled by his partner 's mindless romantic travails .
director jake scott , son of ridley scott ( alien , blade runner ) , has his father 's knack for setting up atmospheric shots but
none of his skill in actually moving the camera .
most of the action scenes are filmed in such a rapid , jerky way that it 's impossible to comprehend what 's going on
.
the camerawork is even more nauseating
than in the purposefully dizzying the blair witch project due to its lack of fluidity .
instead of utilizing panning shots to impress upon us the scope of the events scott uses attention - deficit - disorder edits .
he barely ever holds a shot for more than ten seconds and during the faster scenes it seems more like a couple frames between each cut .
the weird , almost defiant lack of dialogue
( there are no -- no -- conversations lasting over , say , 20 seconds )
undermines character definition and our two protagonists come off as ciphers rather than characters .
the love affair between macleane and rebecca is no different , emotionless and unrealistic .
when the script calls for macleane to decide between going to america and going to meet his lover , there is no reason for us to believe it would be worth it for him to abandon his goal ; he and rebecca barely even speak to each other throughout the film .
plunkett and macleane wants desperately to be a triumph of style over substance but since its style , quite frankly , blows , the film has no hope of succeeding on any level .
i wanted to appreciate this movie on the basis of its admittedly kinetic pace
but i could n't -- it was so kinetic
it gave me a headache .",0,"['it gave me a headache', 'uses attention - deficit - disorder edits', 'emotionless and unrealistic', 'it ruins this one , making a muddled , incoherent mess', 'even more nauseating', 'its style , quite frankly , blows', 'no hope of succeeding', 'weird , almost defiant lack of dialogue', 'mired down by modern mtv pretentions', ""filmed in such a rapid , jerky way that it 's impossible to comprehend what 's going on""]"
"plot : derek zoolander is a male model .
he is also very dumb and impressionable .
for that reason , he is secretly hired and trained ( so secret , that even he does n't know about it ) by an underground fashion syndicate to assassinate the prime minister of malaysia , who wants to abolish child labor in his country .
will zoolander fulfill the dirty deed ?
will zoolander ever grace the world
his new "" look "" ? is this a funny movie ? find out below . . .
critique : there 's a place in our world for "" stupid comedies "" .
films which do n't pretend to take themselves seriously , are based on idiotic premises and filled with dumb jokes .
there 's also a time for them and many would argue that this difficult period of our history , might be an ideal circumstance during which to "" relax "" by watching something so completely frivolous .
well , if you 're in the mood for some seriously mindless entertainment , ben stiller and his cast of many have assembled one of the more original dumb comedies in some time .
of course , comedies as such are usually very subjective and i could see how some will see this film simply as stupid and unfunny , while others will grant them the "" stupid "" , but consider it funny instead .
i personally enjoyed it for the most part , cracked up loudly during a couple of specific sequences and loved the derek zoolander character and the unrestrained whipping they released upon the fashion industry . snap !
it was also nice to see several real - life models with small roles in the movie , not taking themselves too seriously .
and if you 're the type of person who likes celebrity cameos in films , well , do n't look any further because dozens of famous faces show up here including vince vaughn , billy zane , winona ryder , christian slater , david duchovny , natalie portman and many , many others .
i especially liked andy dick 's complete make - over as the masseuse .
hi - larious !
but with all films of this type , there is bound to be some stuff that simply does n't work .
a few particulars which did n't strike my fancy included the bulimia and "" orgy "" sequence with christine taylor , the break - dance fighting , and i also never get why they use real countries in plots like this ( why not just "" make up "" a country , instead of zeroing in on a certain people ? ) .
i also could have done with less of the taylor character in general , since she was n't all that interesting and seemed to slow things down every now and then ( more zoolander , dude ! ) .
but those few missteps were nothing compared to some of the more memorable scenes which definitely did work for me !
i almost pissed myself during the "" gas station "" disaster , absolutely adored the "" walk - off "" contest ( with david bowie as the judge , no less ) and appreciated
many of zoolander 's moronic one - liners ( "" i was a merman . . . a merman ! ! "" ) .
and i dare you to get his "" monkey "" photo shoot out of your head after seeing this movie
( "" you 're a monkey , derek . . .
a monkey !
"" ) i also really liked the soundtrack and the pace of the film , both of which zipped and zagged , and established a nice rhythm to it all .
again , it 's to note that this movie is dumb and not for everyone , but my guess is that if you laughed at the trailer , you will likely enjoy many of the quips in the actual picture as well .
if you thought the trailer was dumb , skip this dodo bird and go rent austin powers again or something , a film from which there is an obvious influence here .

robocop takes place in detroit in the future .
things are pretty bleak .
the company ocp rules the city with an iron fist and is moving in on running the police force .
peter weller plays a cop who goes on a mission with his partner , nancy allen .
peter weller goes in an empty room alone and gets killed .
meanwhile ocp has a failed demonstration of a ed-209 model robot crime fighter .
someone comes up with the idea of having a cyborg robocop so they use any parts worth scalvaging from peter weller and make him into the robocop the movie is titled after .
the plot of this movie generally runs at a decent pace .
it drags a bit towards the end with robocop wanting to finish everybody off , but plot twists keep it exciting .
the acting is bad from weller when he is human , but very good when he is robocop .
nancy allen does a decent job .
this movie does n't leave itself open for a sequel exactly .
but they made one anyway .
enter . . .
robocop 2 starring :
peter weller and nancy allen directed by : irvin kershner detroit is in a more bleak state than it was in the first film .
ocp is trying to develop an improved ' robocop 2 ' that will be more than a match for criminals .
most of the police force is on strike due to ocp taking it over , leaving robocop to be the police force in the city .
this film is pretty bizaare .
it has a 13 year - old drug - lord who curses as much as eddie murphy , even more violence than the original , and some more humor .
the plot of this movie is pretty large , almost too much so .
there are three or four plot lines weaving around that do n't really match up .
the effects are still decent though .
this sequel is n't more of the same really , just a darker version robocop dealing more with drugs than with armed criminals .
if you liked the first one , watch this .
but be dissapointed .
so later comes . . .
robocop 3 starring nancy allen and robert john burke ocp is now owned by a large japanese company .
robocop joins a band of rebels to counter - attack the evil empire ,
i mean ocp .
the japanese send a cyborg - ninja to deal with robocop . among other things . . .
this movie is easier to follow than the last one .
which means the plot is n't quite as crowded .
this movie is n't anything special though .
just more of robocop blasting things up in a more kid - friendly way .
really not reccomended .",1,"['generally runs at a decent pace', 'plot twists keep it exciting', 'the effects are still decent though']"
"how do you judge a film that is so bad , but intentionally so ?
in spiceworld , the highly popular singing group the spice girls accomplish their major goal : mocking themselves with a purposely cheezy film and having a lot of fun doing it .
if that was their goal , they did a fantastic job .
so is it fair to give it such a low grade when it was n't really meant to be much better than this ?
honestly , i 'd rather see this film before many others i gave higher grades ,
so does that mean i graded it inaccurately ?
truth be known , i do n't really think i can answer this question .
to understand spiceworld , you have to understand the spice girls .
unless you 're very
* very * young , or fairly older , you probably have at least heard of them .
they 're a group of five busty british babes who 've had # 1 hit singles and whose debut album sold millions .
they 're primarily adored by pre - teen girls who hope someday the contents of their training bras might match those of ginger spice 's ( real name : geri haliwell ) wonderbra .
all five of the girls have these "" spicy "" names for which they are better known than their real names .
there is the aforementioned ginger spice , as well as sporty spice ( melanie chisholm , or mel c . ) , scary spice ( melanie brown , or mel b . ) , baby spice ( emma bunton ) , and posh spice ( victoria addams ) , and
all of them , to some degree or another , resemble their stage names .
the spice girls took the world by storm , and spiceworld is actually a good- humored spoof of all that transpired during their quick rise to fame .
it 's quite nice to see what good sports the girls are ( and not just the one dubbed sporty ) about poking fun at themselves .
they do n't take themselves too seriously , and that 's probably the best thing about them .
it 's also surprising how natural they seem in front of the camera * acting * , and not just singing and dancing .
they 're not flawless by any means , but for the most part , they deliver their lines without feeling staged , and , like them or not , we get the sense the five are very at home within their characters ( which seems reasonable since they portray themselves ) .
what makes the film bad is that extreme fans of the spice girls wo n't get enough of their music , while the rest of us do n't get enough of a movie .
the real point of this is to look at the spice girls for over ninety straight minutes .
most of the film is very blas ? , but several parts are downright boring , and then they have those sporadic moments that actually make us laugh out loud !
if you 're a big fan of the group , you probably wo n't get enough of what you want , and if you 're not a big fan , you get too much time devoted to nothing more than "" look at us "" moments .
for the right crowd , the "" music video "" sequences will be the highlights of the film , but for others , they will serve as three - minute lulls in a hectic - but - overall - uneventful storyline .
other key actors include richard e . grant as clifford , the spice girls ' manager , alan cumming as the film - maker piers cutherton - smyth who attempts to make a documentary of the group , george wendt as martin barnfield , a producer who constantly works on pitching a spice girls movie , and roger moore in a small , self - parodizing role .
all provide relatively good performances , keeping in mind once again that this film was n't meant to be acted seriously .
even meat loaf shows up as dennis the bus driver and seems to have fun with it .
while this film is continuously compared to the beatles ' a hard day 's night , i think that is an unjust comparison .
it is supposedly the movie studio that first mad the comparison by way of press kits , but i do n't think drector bob spiers , nor the spice girls , intended it to be so .
i think the studios were just trying to boost hype and interest in the film , and have instead , come off rather pretentious
.
i do n't think this film is trying to be anything more than a fun , satirical look at a group that got so big , a movie seemed the next likely step .
and what could 've been better than a self - indulged yet self- mocking approach ?
probably nothing , and so it is .
spiceworld is a movie i thought would be embarrassing to enjoy , but now instead , i find myself wanting to defend a movie i did n't even give a good review .
it 's bad , but it succeeds in every way it intended .
it gives the spice girls a chance to play while allowing all those obsessive fans out there to indulge in every brainless moment .
perhaps the group is nothing more than a gimmick .
if that 's the case , the movie 's gimmick is that it * is * such a gimmick !
you might be saying , "" a spice girls movie ? come on ! ""
,
but when it comes down to it , i think that 's the point .",0,"['have instead , come off rather pretentious', 'several parts are downright boring', 'what makes the film bad', 'three - minute lulls in a hectic - but - overall - uneventful storyline', ""it 's bad""]"
""" battlefield earth "" is the best comedy of the year .
it has to be .
the other prospect is just too horrifying to consider .
bad movie syndrome struck me again , so after witnessing how much "" battlefield earth "" has been proclaimed a train wreck in both critical and popular circles , i felt the masochistic urge to see the disaster first - hand . is it as bad as advertised ?
oh yes , very much so .
the plot is incomprehensible .
the acting is atrocious .
the special effects are mediocre .
the action is dull .
the implausibilities are legion .
the dialogue is cringe - inducing .
the whole package is funny when it wants to be serious and irritating when it wants to be funny .
i do n't even want to continue reviewing this movie ; i 'd like to purge the atrocity from my mind as soon as possible , but you probably want to read my thrashing in all its sarcastic glory , so here it is : the premise is basically a rip - off of "" planet of the apes , "" only minus the apes and philosophical discussion , and plus a race of evil aliens from the planet psychlo .
the year is 3000 , the psychlos have conquered earth , and the human population has been enslaved .
only a handful of humans escaped to radiation - rich areas to escape the aliens ; they live out their lives in fear .
one man , johnny goodboy
( i know , i know ) tyler ( barry pepper ) , ventures to the outworld and is captured by the psychlos .
there he confronts the psychlo head of security : a big , ugly , klingon - looking creature called terl ( john travolta ) .
pressed into slavery , johnny vows to lead a revolution and take the planet back .
meanwhile , terl is faced with his own problems : he has recently learned that he 's stuck living on earth ( which he hates ) for the rest of his career because he pissed off his boss by sleeping with the big man 's daughter .
he decides to give johnny knowledge of the psychlo language and technology ( this is where the plot gets ridiculous . . . ) so the "" man - animal "" can lead a mining expedition into places the psychlos ca n't go .
terl then plans to keep the mined gold for himself .
of course , his plan does n't work .
so many things wrong with this movie -- where to begin ?
how about with travolta , whose hollywood clout brought about this , the cinematic version of scientology guru l . ron hubbard 's sci - fi novel ?
early previews for "" battlefield earth , "" with constant shots of a makeup - laden travolta cackling like lex luthor , had me ( and several audience members ) remarking , "" what the hell is travolta thinking ?
""
the movie did nothing to stem such remarks .
all that ridiculous cackling he did in the trailers is in full force here
: terl cackles after nearly every line , and so does every other psychlo .
of course , this makes every scene hilariously overwrought , no more so than when the script clumsily stumbles into political commentary .
the psychlos are probably supposed to be some kind of satire of corporate america , but ceos generally do n't laugh maniacally after denying pay raises to their employees .
( "" you were going to be promoted -- but now you 're not !
fwahahahahahahahaha ! ! ! ! !
""
)
it 's no big surprise terl loses to the humans -- he 's an idiot .
he breaks every kind of supervillain rule in the book .
he underestimates his enemies , assuming he 'll win just because he 's smarter .
( he uses the word "" leverage "" like some sort of scientologist mantra . )
not content to go the james bond villain route of explaining his plans to the hero , he hooks him up to a machine that gives him knowledge of all the psychlos ' language and technology .
( why this machine is even around in the first place is beyond me . )
he then appears shocked that johnny points a gun at him .
no wonder this guy never got his promotion .
the plot inconsistencies are too numerous to mention .
why do the psychlos build an earth base in which both they and the human slaves must wear little breathing apparatuses to survive ?
how come the psychlos are wasting their time mining for gold when the doors of fort knox are wide open ?
how in the world did all those fighter jets survive sitting in a hangar for 1 , 000 years ?
and how do all these previously brain - dead cavemen learn to fly them so quickly ?
there 's a whole lot more to scratch one 's head about in "" battlefield earth .
"" bring a scorecard to track the plot holes .
director roger christian shoots "" battlefield earth
"" in the most distracting way possible , tilting nearly every shot sideways for no discernible reason .
all the characters appear to be standing on the walls , and it 's awfully difficult to watch a movie when you must tilt your head just to watch ordinary passages of dialogue .
the action sequences are atrociously edited ,
every one turned into an endless slow - motion parade that drains all potential excitement .
are these things really so hard to construct ?
my respect for supposed "" lightweight "" action directors has grown by leaps and bounds after witnessing in "" battlefield earth "" how badly an action sequence can be shot .
this movie is an absolute headache .
it 's not just the shot selection and editing ;
the movie , quite frankly , makes no sense .
for most of "" battlefield earth 's "" running time , i just did n't know what was happening .
it did n't have anything to do with me finding the events stupid or illogical ( though they certainly are ) --
i really had no idea what the hell was going on
.
when i pieced the plot together later , it did n't look any better .
here 's how much of a disaster this is : "" battlefield earth "" is already the worst movie of the year , and it 's going to take something really , really inept to top it .
the only thing we can take comfort in about the film is that no one will be suckered into joining the church of scientology because of it .
in fact , i 'd think that hubbard 's cult would want to distance themselves from this bomb as fast as possible .
that 'll teach me to give into bad movie syndrome again .",0,"['in the most distracting way possible', 'so many things wrong with this movie', 'the plot is incomprehensible . the acting is atrocious . the special effects are mediocre . the action is dull . the implausibilities are legion . the dialogue is cringe - inducing', 'bring a scorecard to track the plot holes', 'bad movie syndrome struck me again', 'this movie is an absolute headache', 'the movie , quite frankly , makes no sense', 'i really had no idea what the hell was going on', 'the plot inconsistencies are too numerous to mention', 'is it as bad as advertised ? oh yes , very much so', 'irritating when it wants to be funny', 'the worst movie of the year', 'all that ridiculous cackling he did in the trailers is in full force here', 'this bomb', 'every one turned into an endless slow - motion parade that drains all potential excitement']"
"contact is the 1997 movie i 've seen the most - five times to be exact .
four of those times were on the big screen , but even on a tv ,
it 's a very impressive film .
the same ca n't be said for films like independance day , but that 's because contact is a rare example in sci - fi filmmaking where the story is treated more importantly than the special effects , and all of us know looking back that id4 did n't offer much outside of some one - time delightful eye candy .
contact 's wonderfully presented story deals with ellie arroway ( jodie foster ) , a radio astronomer whose preference of study involves the outdated technique of "" merely listening "" to sounds out in space .
her interest in the field of astronomy developed at a very young age , encouraged by her loving father , ted ( david morse ) , who let ellie use a small ham radio to pick up on frequencies and communicate with people as far away as pensacola , fl ( that was , of course , before the days of internet chat rooms ) .
while everyone else uses modern technologies to aid them in the search for extra - terrestrial intelligence ( of which the program seti is an acronym for ) , ellie prefers to pop on a pair of headphones and see what she can pick up on , keeping the youthful magic and intrigue strongly alive .
ellie 's strong scientific basis essentially makes her an atheist , a belief likely influenced by the death of her father while she was still quite young .
in puerto rico , she meets palmer joss ( matthew mcconaughey ) , a writer examining the effects of technology on the world 's overall happiness ; a one- time seminary student who describes himself as "" a man of the cloth , without the cloth "" .
despite the vast differences in opinion regarding a "" supreme being "" , ellie and palmer hit it off , and even take the time to sleep together .
it 's a weak and hurried relationship , but director zemeckis needs it to add to the plot later on .
meanwhile , dr .
david drumlin ( tom skerritt ) , who has authority over seti but finds the program a frivolous waste of time and money , is ready to pull the plug on any and all seti funding .
this leaves the passionate ellie searching for new sponsors , eventually finding a setup in new mexico and leaving palmer with no explanation , and only a one night stand to remember .
it is in this nm city where , several months later , ellie finally picks up on a strong signal from outer space , perhaps the most profound discovery in the history of science .
when the signal is closely examined , many new developments spring up , and before long , drumlin is stepping in to take over the operation he once scoffed at .
eventually , it is concluded that information in the signal may be blueprints for a transportation device used to teleport an earthling to vega ( where the signal seems to have originated ) .
the media swarms , fanatics go further off the deep end , scientists clamor for new information , politicians huddle in discussion of appropriate actions to take , and presidents are morphed into a celluloid reality ( remember when zemeckis could n't get enough of this in forrest gump ? ) .
as if that were n't enough , ellie 's discovery leads her to the nation 's capital where she again runs into palmer .
contact is based on the novel by carl sagan and deals heavily with the subject of science vs . religion .
the impressive thing is how well both aspects are presented , with no signs of bias .
arguments for both sides are intelligent , solid , and thought - provoking .
when palmer joins a selection committee to choose an ambassador to vega ( of which ellie is a leading candidate ) , personal convictions play a more important role than love interests .
the question is , can a person who does n't believe in god truly be the best representative of earth when 90 % of the planet * does * believe in a higher power ?
even when the film wraps up , it 's uncertain whether it 's meant to play as an advocate for religion , science , both , or even neither , and in our modern day society where "" right and wrong "" is only opinion ( at least speaking "" politically correctly "" )
, the ambiguity is an incentive .
do n't get me wrong .
as much as it sounds like it , contact is n't merely a theology class rolled into a reel of film .
it 's a * highly * enjoyable two and a half hours .
despite its seemingly heavy issues , it 's not a tedious undertaking to watch this film .
the special effects are outstanding , though ( warning ! )
highly depreciated on the small screen .
even so , some of the subtle visual effects ( that will likely go unnoticed by many ) are even more impressive than ones more recognizable as "" sci - fi "" .
the storytelling is rich and complete , and although there are moments in the film that feel quite pretentious ( and at times , even hokey ) , it 's
easily one of the best 1997 films , and one of the best sci - fi films i 've ever seen
.
this is zemeckis ' best since back to the future , and for those of us who actually know that forrest gump was astronomically overrated , zemeckis now has real reason to boast .",1,"['has real reason to boast', 'the special effects are outstanding', ""it 's a very impressive film"", ""it 's a * highly * enjoyable"", ""one of the best sci - fi films i 've ever seen"", 'are even more impressive', 'easily one of the best', 'rich and complete']"
"i should have known , damn it , i should have known .
ewan mcgregor - codename :
"" eye "" - is pointing a high - tech rifle - ly gadget at a fat , bald business - oriented american engaging in illicit sexual activities in a window across the street .
we get the requisite electro - green through - the - sight view .
we the audience , seeing a high tech rifle - ly gadget , of course think that eye is going to assassinate the target , but instead , he pulls the trigger and the rifle takes twenty or so hazy , low - quality photographs , which eye then proceeds to fax and e - mail to everyone in his target 's office .
all right , so thirty seconds in , i was slightly befuddled by this seemingly pointless rifle / camera , but i was still open minded .
. .
maybe there 's a really good reason for it .
i 've got reason to believe , you see - i admire a lot of ewan mcgregor 's previous work . . .
and he 's obi
wan ke- friggin - nobi for god 's sake .
and director stephan elliot 's last movie priscilla ,
queen of the desert was a quirky little delight .
there 's some genuine talent involved here .
i think at the twenty minute mark , there was still a spark of hope in my heart .
eye has been assigned to investigate the leader of his organization 's son
( i still have no idea what this organization was - british intelligence ?
national spy ring ?
private investigation ? )
, who is apparently stealing from his trust fund .
he has received his assignment from k .
d .
lang , through an elaborate and expensive teleconferencing briefcase .
when eye tracks his target to an expensive- looking secluded house , he witnesses a mysterious and beautiful woman ( ashley judd ) take a knife out and proceed to stab the poor bastard .
ok , that 's odd , i think to myself , this could be interesting .
then she starts to cry , and through her tears exclaims "" merry christmas , dad ! "" for the first time .
so begins our tale of obsession .
. .
or . . . something .
the rest of the movie involves ewan mcgregor 's eye character following ashley judd around to every corner of the united states , totally and completely obsessed by this woman from afar .
throughout his entire professional life , he has been a voyeur ; so when he falls for someone , the only way he can handle it is to watch and drool through telescopes and cameras .
fine , that 's a lovely premise , i suppose .
but gosh darn it ,
if you 're going to go there , you better have some sort of explanation .
and that 's precisely where this film fails .
this is the kind of movie that pisses me off .
it 's an abortion , a collection of half - formed and wasted ideas that amounts to absolutely nothing in the end .
it pretends it is something that it is not - a surreal and deep psychological character study wrapped in a high - tech thriller .
here , the filmmakers have confused "" surreal "" and "" deep "" with "" vaguely unclear "" and "" crammed full of insultingly obvious metaphors .
""
i never , even for an instant , had the foggiest idea why eye would fall so in "" love "" with this woman who changes wigs and kills people .
the movie offers only two explanations , neither of which make a lick of sense .
explanation number one : the obnoxious presence of eye 's imaginary daughter , who was taken away from him by his wife some time ago , tells him he should n't leave ms .
judd .
explanation two , which by the end of the film has been beaten into our heads through imagery and dialog and even the title of the movie :
"" beauty is in the eye of the beholder .
"" whoo hoo , that helps ,
thanks a bunch , case closed .
that 's as deep as it gets , folks .
there is an attempt at an explanation in the final minutes , which , instead of tying everything together , ends up being as profound as a clever sixth - grade mad lib .
there are secondary characters that move in and out of the picture and
serve little or no purpose except to make the audience wonder what the hell the point was .
my personal favorites include : the prison - matron modeled after austin powers ' frau farbissina , who apparently taught ms .
judd everything she knows about wearing wigs
; jason priestley 's awfully played dirty desert vagrant # 1 , who tries to emulate dennis hopper a la blue velvet , but fails miserably ; and the cop - who - sees - ashley - fleeing - an - accident - scene - and- then - wants - to - pay - for - sex-
but - is - shot .
each one in this sad little parade is a little more pointless than the last .
the script pays no attention to the laws of time and space .
any time one of the frequent location changes occurs , the camera zooms in on a souvenir snow globe , and minutes , weeks , or years could have passed .
bewilderingly inane stylistic decisions plague the whole affair - one character passes a glass of cognac to another in a slow - motion close - up awash in a lot of bass .
ewan mcgregor at one point takes up residence in a bell tower just so he could be repeatedly awakened and deafened by the giant bell .
jason priestly starts philosophizing about sharks , then laughs maniacally . . .
cut to random guy with eye patch . . .
iguana out of focus .

iguana comes into focus .

when i found out afterward that this film was based on a novel , it came as no surprise to me .
there are plenty of elements here
that , if extended and fleshed out more , would have made for a decent story .

not that anything would ever possess me to purchase such a thing to find out what i was missing .
the last ten or so minutes featured a conversation between the eye and the judd that was supposed to be some sort of revealing exposition .
some guy in the back of the theater was talking on his cell phone , and this time i did n't particularly care all that much because what was happening on the screen was a steaming pile of unholy crap
; the audience around me chuckled and whispered sentiments similar to what i was thinking .

"after a marketing windup of striking visuals and the promise of star caliber actors , mission to mars ends up throwing a whiffleball .
fiercely unoriginal , director depalma cobbles together a film by borrowing heavily from what has gone before him .
there are aliens similar to those in close encounters of the third kind .
the stranded astronaut theme is reminiscent of robinson crusoe on mars .
the astronauts encounter space flight difficulties that smack of apollo 13 .
interior spacecraft visuals are redolent of 2001 : a space odyssey . instead of using these components as a launching pad to create his own movie , de palma stops right there , refusing to infuse the film with anything even remotely resembling cleverness or heart .
mission to mars takes it 's first wobbly steps at a pre - launch barbeque in which the perfunctory character introductions are done .
during these surface scans of the characters , we learn that jim mcconnell ( sinise ) has lost his wife .
it 's a plot point revisted throughout the film with jackhammer subtlety .
the rest of the crew exhibit a bland affability .
there is no contentiousness , no friction to add the the dramatic tension of these men and women being confined to close quarters for an extended length of time .
maybe depalma was going for the comraderie of the right stuff , but in that movie , the astronauts had embers of personality to warm us through the technical aspects .
it 's the year 2020 and this is nasa 's first manned excursion to the red planet .
a crew , led by luke graham ( cheadle ) , arrives on mars and quickly discovers an anomaly , which they investigate with tragic results .
graham is able to transmit a garbled distress call back to earth .
in response , earth sends a rescue team comprised of mcconnell , woody blake ( robbins ) , wife terri fisher ( nielsen ) and phil ohlmyer ( o'connell ) .
obstacles are put in the crew 's way
and and they matter - of- factly go about solving them .
i should say , mcconnell goes about solving them .
time and again , mcconnell is presented as some kind of wunderkind , which would n't be so bad if the rest of the crew did n't come across as so aggressivelly unremarkable .
( mention should be made of the misogynistic handling of fisher in a situation where the entire crew 's mission and life is in mortal danger .
on a team of professionals , she is portrayed as an emotion directed weak link .
women serve no purpose in the movie other than to serve as a reflection of a male character 's personality trait . )
by the time they land on mars and try to solve the mystery of what occurred , mission to mars starts laying on the cliches and stilted dialogue with a heavy brush .
there is an adage in film to "" show , do n't tell .
"" mission to mars does both . repeatedly .
characters obsessively explain the obvious , explain their actions as they are doing them , explain to fellow astronauts facts which should be fundamental knowledge to them .
the film 's conclusion is momumentally derivative , anti - climatic and unsatisying .
as i walked out i wondered who the target audience might be for this film .
the best i could come up with is pre - teen age boys , but in this media saturated era , this film 's components would have been old hat even for them .
i have to think what attracted such talent to this film was the lure of making a good , modern day b - movie .

joe is a combination of animatronic effects , computer graphics , and that old standard , a man in a monkey suit .

"" --there 's also some surprising cheesiness .
one of the film 's most embarrassing moments is when paxton 's band of african trackers first encounter and pursue the larger - than - life primate ( in a scene unashamedly ripped off from "" the lost world : jurassic park "" ) .
paxton jubilantly extols the beast 's majestic gait at the same exact moment as joe , and the computer effects driving him , stutter to a halt .
also , if the film 's producers had wanted us to focus our attentions on the titular ape they should n't have paraded female lead charlize theron ( "" trial & error "" ) around in a seemingly - endless wardrobe of spaghetti - strapped tops .
even joe seems distracted at times .

maybe not !
mindless fun is one thing , but brain - dead slop is another matter altogether .
tango & cash has "" lowest common denominator "" written all over it .
the movie stars sylvester stallone and kurt russell as rival undercover cops in l .
a .
russell plays cash , a reckless slob who dresses in jeans and tee shirts .
stallone plays tango , a wealthy investor who works on the force strictly for the thrill of it ; he does n't need the money .
in an effort to change his image , stallone goes for a yuppie , gq look in the film , wearing spectacles and three piece suits .
the two detectives reluctantly become partners after they are framed for murder and have to break out of prison to clear their names .
tango & cash is unbearably noisy . for starters , there 's harold faltermeyer 's annoying synthesized score , which gets old after four notes . to make matters worse
, the filmmakers seem to think that when it comes to loud explosions and screeching cars , the more the merrier .
in fact , the movie begins with not one but two car chases .
there 's nothing like a good old car chase to introduce the characters in a movie .
screenwriter randy feldman 's brain must have gone to mush from watching too many cop shows on tv .
his shockingly stupid screenplay undermines anything and everything
the movie has going for it , such as stallone 's efforts to convince you that tango is an intellectual .
in a movie with the iq level of an amoeba , even a great actor is going to have trouble looking intelligent -- and stallone is no lawrence olivier .
it 's hard to imagine anyone reading feldman 's script and thinking , "" i want to be in this movie .
"" the film 's plot does n't have one original bone in its body , and -- again -- you have to point your finger at the screenwriting .
feldman 's story line succumbs to every crime thriller cliche in the book , making tango & cash altogether generic and predictable
.
they simply could have called it "" action movie .
""
every character , every twist and turn , is stolen from television or from other movies . adding insult to injury , tango & cash is about as believable as a "" road runner "" cartoon .
action movies do n't have to be realistic , but they should absorb you enough so that you 're not thinking about the lack of realism .
the only artistic aspect of tango & cash is the cinematography .
there are some spectacular shots , especially during the rainy nighttime prison break in which tango and cash slide to safety on electrical wires .
the film 's main draw is the chemistry between stallone and russell .
unfortunately , their relationship rarely progresses past macho competition as they endlessly bicker about who packs more meat in his pants .
the dialogue consists of nothing but one - liners , and consequently the attempts at character development are embarrassing
.
it 's a shame because with a workable screenplay , russell and stallone could have turned tango & cash into a charming "" lethal weaponesque "" adventure .
tango & cash tries to maintain a light tone , and you do laugh about once every five minutes .
seeing russell in drag is the movie 's funniest moment , but you probably already have seen it in the commercials .
furthermore , the light tone does not sit well against the relentlessly brutal violence .
machine guns and torture generally do n't mix well with comedy .
jack palance appears in tango & cash doing what he does best : playing a sleazy , conniving villain .
his character , however , is run - of - the - mill , except for his strange obsession with mice .
like many movie villains , palance likes to play games .
in fact , he sets a ridiculously elaborate trap for tango and cash , a trap which sends the two detectives to prison so they can be beaten and electrocuted by some meanies in the boiler room .
you have to wonder why palance does n't just shoot the detectives in the head !
the story would crumble if any of the characters were to do anything intelligent .
teri hatcher plays stallone 's sister and russell 's love - interest , and she is just as pretty as can be .
but regrettably , hatcher 's acting is not on par with her exceptional beauty .
every time she opens her mouth , you cringe ; corny dialogue and atrocious acting are always a fatal combination
.
there 's really very little , if anything , to recommend in the film .
and , more to the point , tango definitely is n't worth a penny of your cash -- so do n't bother .",0,"['unbearably noisy', 'to make matters worse', 'every time she opens her mouth , you cringe', 'embarrassing', 'generic and predictable', 'corny dialogue and atrocious acting are always a fatal combination', 'annoying synthesized score', 'adding insult to injury', 'run - of - the - mill', ""the film 's plot does n't have one original bone in its body"", 'unfortunately , their relationship rarely progresses', 'acting is not on par', 'his shockingly stupid screenplay undermines anything and everything', 'succumbs to every crime thriller cliche in the book', 'with the iq level of an amoeba', ""definitely is n't worth a penny"", 'has "" lowest common denominator "" written all over it']"
"synopsis : sonny koufax ( adam sandler )
is a rich , childish , angry man who has just been dumped by his girlfriend vanessa ( kristy swanson ) .
in a bid to impress vanessa sonny impersonates his friend kevin ( jon stewart ) and adopts a 5 year old boy named julian ( cole and dylan sprouse ) while kevin is on an overseas trip .
under sonny 's supervision julian soon learns to lie to women , tell people how he "" wipes his ass , "" throw tantrums , and scream for his "" god damned "" treats .
self centered , julian breaks a school classmate 's arm without apologizing or even realizing he has done anything wrong .
meanwhile sonny bribes julian with sugary talk , food , toys , and flashy promises in order to get the kid to perform .
not surprisingly the government takes julian away from sonny 's incompetent supervision , and this leads to a custody battle .
opinion : it 's a movie about an embittered creep teaching a little kid to be a jerk , and we all get cheap laughs
because for 90 minutes the innocent kindergartner never finds out what it means when he mimics all the bad boy behavior .
that 's the essence of big daddy .
but there 's a bigger issue
involved :
marketing .
movies that are rated pg and pg-13 are heavily marketed towards children of preteen age and below .
on tv , film clips advertise these movies as family - friendly hit comedies .
then when you go see them they turn out to be either raunchy sex acts like austin powers with characters named fat bastard - - or big daddy where adult characters get their jollies by buddying up to naive five year olds and encouraging them to experiment with drugs and mistreatment .
folks in hollywood are trying to develop a preteen market for raunchy stuff , but i think most american parents would agree that early childhood is a time of mental innocence that should be protected from uncaring media market exploitation .
to many american mothers
there 's probably nothing more pathetic and unsettling than the sight of a theater full of unsupervised little eight year olds laughing raucously as movie character father adam sandler jokes about a woman 's "" ice cold tits .

"poster boy for co - dependency needs patching patch adams a film review by michael redman copyright 1999 by michael redman mediocrity is a pox on civilization .
in our heavily consumer oriented society , there is an enormous demand to churn out "" stuff .
""
what would happen to our economy if we did n't feel the need to have more things ?
to make us buy more , businesses need to produce a ton of product .
the sheer volume of items necessitates that most of them are of dubious quality .
the film industry is like any other .
in order for studios to survive , they have to make money .
the prevailing attitude is that more films equal more profit .
some movies obviously exist only to put wares on the screen and to do that , less talented people are used .
there are n't enough great directors and actors to create the number of films necessary .
for some reason , it 's never crossed anyone 's mind that the real equation is quality films = more profit .
often , mediocre films are more of a pain for the audience than the horrendous ones .
at you can have a good time making fun of bad movies .
i 'm not suggesting that "" patch adams "" was tossed out just to rake in the bucks .
my guess is that someone was asleep at the wheel .
it features an accomplished actor and a potentially engrossing story , but it 's as dull as could be . hunter "" patch "" adams ' ( robin williams ) desire to become a doctor
has an unusual genesis .
checking himself into a mental institute after a suicide attempt , he discovers that he can help the other patients by clowning around .
patch could be a poster boy for co - dependency .
he explains that he likes devoting himself to others because then he does n't focus on his own problems .
he decides that he wants to be a physician , leaves the place and a couple of years
later enrolls in the medical college of virginia .
as a med student , patch 's antics at the school 's hospital catch the attention of his soon to be arch - enemy , straight - laced dean walcott ( bob gunton ) .
the dean is so opposed to the goofiness that he wants patch kicked out of school although he 's one of the top students .
he writes in patch 's academic file that he shows "" excessive happiness .
""
i walked into the film knowing little about its history and wondered about its odd mechanical pacing .
there also seemed to be no reason that it is set in the early seventies .
then it struck me .
it must be based on a true story .
the movie is an adaptation of a book by hunter adams who founded the gesundheit institute , a free clinic .
robin williams is an amazing actor . while he is adept at dramatic roles , his forte is over - the - top free spirits .
that 's what makes his failure here so remarkable .
patch is exactly the character he should be best at , yet
even the scene where he and another mental patient are battling fierce imaginary squirrels falls flat .
something holds him back .
most of the rest of the cast is two - dimensional . for a film that champions seeing patients as human beings , it 's curious that the ones here are cardboard characters
.
peter coyote as a man dying of cancer is refreshing because he seems like a real person .
unfortunately he 's in the film for only about two minutes .
the audience is blatantly lead by a ring in its nose from scene to scene .
we 're not left to our own emotional decisions : we 're hit over the head with them . shaved - headed children with cancer , an elderly woman whom patch makes laugh , a beautiful woman who ca n't love because of her abusive history .
when a group of students fix up an old house to use as a clinic in the andy hardy "" hey , let 's put on a play !
we can use the barn and my mom can make the curtains !
"" mode , they laugh and roll around while painting each other .
there might as well be giant signs flashing : "" feel good now ! ""
"" feel bad now ! ""
"" patch "" is a good title for the film .
it is a patchwork of every manipulative scene you can think of .
the full - of - life student fights stodgy establishment types .
there 's a touching death .
then there 's another .
the film does n't trust us to get it the first time .
the dean tries to kick patch out and later he tries again .
worst of all is the final courtroom bit .
scary - looking old men sit in judgment of a man who only wants to help people .
the room is packed with patch 's supporters .
williams makes a supposedly impassioned speech about the humanity of all .
it has as much emotion as his earlier statement "" humans are the only animal that kills members of its own species
"" contains truth .
most of the blame must be placed with the director tom shadyac and screenwriter steve oedekerk .
shadyac also directed the first "" ace ventura "" movie .
oedekerk directed the second one .
need i say more ?
the real adams is to be admired for his devotion to treating patients as people rather than diseases .
the film has a number of worthy messages about the state of the modern medical business with hmos and managed care .
the "" doctors are not gods "" theme will resonate with a number of people , but it 's so poorly produced that no one will care .",0,"['falls flat', 'something holds him back . most of the rest of the cast is two - dimensional', 'it is a patchwork of every manipulative scene you can think of', 'unfortunately', ""it 's as dull as could be"", ""we 're hit over the head with them"", 'a supposedly impassioned speech', 'most of the blame must be placed', ""it 's so poorly produced that no one will care"", 'blatantly lead by a ring in its nose from scene to scene', 'the ones here are cardboard characters', 'worst of all is', 'his failure here']"
"i think of i know what you did last summer as the movie that scream and scream 2 could have been .
mind you , though ,
i mean this in the worst possible way .
i know what you did last summer is a typical slasher flic without the smarts of the scream 's .
as a result , it 's even worse than some of your better campy horror pictures ( see nightmare on elm street ) because it thinks it 's about thirty times smarter than it is .
based on a teen book of the same name and , disappointingly ,
adapted by scream scribe kevin williamson , i know what you did last summer begins with appropriately angsty modern rock music combined with some startling cinematography of a cliff along the ocean and an angsty sort sitting at the top .
the appropriate mood being set ( this is angst - horror for the 90 's ) , we cut over to the july 4th parade in a small north carolina town .
from there , we see the blond , female protagonist , helen shivers ( woodenly played by sarah michelle geller ) , getting crowned croaker queen as the blond male "" hero , "" barry cox ( woodenly played by ryan phillipe ) , and matched brunette pair of protagonists , julie james and ray bronson ( woodenly played by party of five 's jennifer love hewitt and freddie prinze jr . , respectively ) cheer her on .
after getting drunk at a party , going to a beach to wittily discuss urban legend and indulge in some foreshadowing , and having some meaningful sex ( if you believe what the characters say ) , the four run down some guy crossing the windy cliff road at night .
his face is mangled so they ca n't tell who it is , and they come to the decision to dump him in the ocean so as to not ruin any of their future chances for success in the world .
cut to one year later .
the lives of our protagonists have gone from annoying to bad .
main brunette female , the bright one of the bunch , has been plagued with guilt and almost failed out of college .
blond female has forfeited her dreams of starring on guiding light , and now works at the family store in town .
brunette male is a fisherman , living off the land .
blond male has become a complete jerk and quarterback on some college football team .
then , predictably , their past comes back to haunt them .
it all begins with an irrational murder , followed by some taunting of protagonists by the mysterious killer ,
bad acting by a good actress ( anne heche )
, an improbable plot , bad acting by the main bad actors , some more killing , concluding in a climactic scene , mostly climactic in the relief at the end of the movie .
all the while , the actors and actresses spout off bad lines , and main brunette male
does his best keanu reeves imitation .
not that the movie was without pleasure .
count the illogical plot twists and bad lines for some fun .
mostly , though , note the costumes of main females and how trendily unattractive they make the otherwise eye - catching pair look .",0,"['i mean this in the worst possible way', 'have gone from annoying to bad', 'an improbable plot', 'without the smarts', 'bad acting', 'the actors and actresses spout off bad lines', 'disappointingly', 'illogical plot twists and bad lines']"
"capsule : silly and inane adaptation of gibson 's short story , which is nowhere in sight .
gibson 's script only adds insult to injury .
johnny mnemonic is an awesomely bad movie .
i say "" awesomely "" because it 's one thing to fail , but another thing entirely to fail so completely that even the chances for camp value are sabotaged .
keanur reeves
( who is terrible ) stars as johnny , an "" information courier "" who can carry dozens of gigabytes of data in his head .
he is given "" one last job "" ( whenever you are in a movie and you hear those words , run ) , which involves him shoving so much data into his cranium that it could be lethal .
one of the neater touches that the movie brings in is that the only way he could make such an arrangement work was by ditching all of his childhood memories , but it 's only followed up on in a token fashion .
for his trouble , johnny gets chased by the yakuza , who seem to be the new bad guys in all the high - tech thrillers .
what 's funny is that if you watch gangster movies made * in * japan , there are whole gobs of details about genuine yakuza behavior and ethics , but of course there 's no room in this movie for any of that .
the yakuza are simply used to point guns , wave swords , flaunt tattoos , and grimace menacingly .
( i could go on about how gangsters and criminals of many other ethnicities have gotten thoughtful examinations in the movies -- bound by honor , sugar hill and american me come to mind -- when asians remain perpetually stereotyped .
but that 's another essay . )
anyway , johnny runs and eventually winds up in newark .
why newark ?
maybe because it was cheaper to fake a future newark than a future new york , that 's why .
there , he meets an assortment of odd characters ( ice - t , dolph lundgren and henry rollins play a whole gallery of weirdos ) .
the script deals with them with all the depth of pieces of furniture .
it turns out ( what else ? ) that the data in johnny 's head could save a lot of people , but of course johnny only wants it out of his head so it does n't kill him .
handled right , this could have been absorbing , but the script manages to mangle any chance of real sympathy for johnny at every opportunity .
the details about the look and feel of the future are all phoned in from other , better movies -- blade runner and brazil come to mind .
everything looks run - down and scummy
, everyone dresses like they 're punk rockers , and videophones are commonplace .
snore .
the only really interesting flourish is an extended depiction of the way the internet might work in the future ( complete with vr goggles and feedback gloves ) , but i kept thinking that it was more like what some relatively un - technical fellow would * think
* it would look and behave like .
a hacker of johnny 's caliber would be blasting away with one command - line function after another , instead of wasting all this time twiddling with holograms , but of course that 's not cinematic .
whatever .
what went wrong with this movie ?
gibson wrote his own screenplay , which i guess is part of the problem : what works as a short story does n't work in a movie .
his ear for dialogue is terrible and the plot does n't advance , it convulses .
from the script on out , it was probably all downhill .
renting the movie to make fun of it is sort of pointless ; there 's no fun in kicking a wounded dog , is there ?",0,"['only adds insult to injury', 'an awesomely bad movie', ""his ear for dialogue is terrible and the plot does n't advance , it convulses"", 'the script deals with them with all the depth of pieces of furniture', '( who is terrible )', 'everything looks run - down and scummy', 'what went wrong with this movie ?', 'the script manages to mangle any chance of real sympathy', ""why newark ? maybe because it was cheaper to fake a future newark than a future new york , that 's why ."", 'silly and inane adaptation', 'part of the problem', 'it was probably all downhill']"
"steve soderbergh 's "" sex , lies , and videotape , "" which won the grand prize at the cannes film festival in 1989 , arguably began the resurgence of independent films .
made on a shoestring budget of $ 1 . 2 million , with then relatively unknown actors , it is a provocative , thoroughly original drama .
the film mostly focuses on the four central characters , all in their late 20's - early 30 's .
ann ( andie macdowell ) , an unfulfilled housewife , is married to john ( peter gallagher ) , an insensitive lawyer , who , unbeknownst to her , is having an affair with her younger sister , cynthia ( laura san giacomo ) .
complicating matters even worse is graham ( james spader , who won best actor at cannes ) , john 's old college buddy , who comes to stay at their house .
ann is absolutely won over by him , even though she clearly has stated that she has very little interest in sex .
that is the set - up for the last hour of the picture , and since the film is entitled , "" sex , lies , and videotape , "" it is best to keep the rest of the story developments at bay so that they will come as a genuine surprise .
director steven soderbergh has proven to be a wildly offbeat filmmaker , ranging from the independent , to the mainstream ( 1998 's "" out of sight "" ) , to the downright kafkaesque ( 1997 's "" schizopolis "" ) .
he is the type of director who obviously takes a lot of chances , and believes in the work that he does , and , "" sex , lies , and videotape , "" is probably his most confident , and maybe even best , to date .
the performances are superb from all four leads , but macdowell stands out in what is probably the main character .
she is always a very winning actress , but this is probably her most three - dimensional role that she has had ( with a close second being altman 's 1993 mosaic , "" short cuts "" ) .
the other parts are perfectly cast as well , from spader 's ominous graham , to gallagher 's self - involved john , to giacomo 's outspoken cynthia .
the final act of the film , especially , comes right out of left field , and turns out to be both shocking and oddly touching , and it would be criminal to give away the film 's secrets .
suffice to say that , through one powerful sequence , ann is able to somewhat come out of her shell , and john learns a valuable lesson about honesty , as well as deception .
the film has one fault , however .
the characters are almost all emotionally cold and isolated from one another , and often unlikable .
if there had been a few extra scenes with gallagher , it probably would have helped , since his relationship with macdowell is n't quite as explored as i would have liked .
""
sex , lies , and videotape , "" although minorly flawed , is still easily a brave and adult motion picture that is far more mature and honest about its subject matter than the usual film .
soderbergh clearly knew what he was doing while he was making it , and the final product certainly proves this .",1,"['his most confident , and maybe even best , to date', 'her most three - dimensional role', 'the performances are superb', 'a provocative , thoroughly original drama', 'perfectly cast']"

and with her naval officer husband stationed somewhere in the north atlantic , virtually impossible to reach by telephone , margaret leads the crazed life of a single parent .
but margaret 's hectic world is about to get a lot more complicated .
her teenage son beau , a talented trumpet player with strong prospects of being accepted into wesleyan university 's music program , has fallen in with the wrong crowd .
his mother drives from their idyllic , lakeside community of tahoe city , california to the sprawling urban metropolis of reno , nevada , with its imposing concrete superstructures and seedy neon - lit nightclubs , to confront the 30-something man who has befriended beau .
"" stay away from my son "" margaret warns darby reese .
her words , however , appear to fall on deaf ears as reese turns up drunk at the family homestead later that evening , urging beau to join him in the boathouse .
there are words and advances and some pushing and shoving and beau runs back into the house , passed his startled mother , as the crack of a wooden railing giving way breaks the cold blue silence and an intoxicated reese tumbles out of sight .
the next day , on her morning walk , margaret discovers reese 's lifeless body lying crumpled on the shoreline , a boat anchor impaled in his chest .
with her maternal instincts working overtime , margaret quickly ferries the body out into the lake , weighs it down , and dumps it overboard .
but margaret 's life is about to get a lot more complicated .
soon after the body is discovered , snagged on a local fisherman 's line , margaret is paid a visit by an attractive - seeming blackmailer in a red nova .
alek spera threatens to hand over compromising videotape of beau to the police unless margaret comes up with $ 50 , 000 by 4 o'clock the next day .
but margaret 's life is about to get a lot more complicated , for alek
turns out to be something she never expected .
based on elisabeth sanxay holding 's novel "" the blank wall , "" "" the deep end "" is a well - crafted thriller written and directed by scott mcgehee and david siegel ( "" suture "" ) .
it makes the most of a talented but not particularly well - known cast -- goran visnjic plays alek with a suave likeability , jonathan tucker shines as the conflicted beau , peter donat is amusing as grandfather hall , and josh lucas has an equally small but effective role as the hapless darby reese .
the film is also lovingly photographed by giles nuttgens and features an evocative score , courtesy peter nashel .
but it owes everything to british actress tilda swinton .
swinton , whose pale - faced ethereal beauty has graced many of derek jarman 's films
( "" caravaggio , "" "" edward ii , "" "" the last of england "" ) , plays margaret hall in "" the deep end "" and , like charlotte rampling in this year 's "" under the sand , "" turns in a commanding and accomplished performance .
margaret is a devoted mother who is willing to risk everything to protect the ones she loves , and swinton captures every frustration , every fear , every subtle examination and every fervent realization and every nervous oscillation of her being .
the role calls for an extremely wide range of emotions none the least of which is simply playing a mother beset with a multitude of domestic responsibilities .
many can relate to that , of course ; it 's the murder cover - up and the blackmail and the fear of losing one 's son that swinton so gracefully , so graciously , makes resonate with the truest of colors .
the end is deep all right , and there is n't a single shallow moment in tilda swinton 's canon .",1,"['turns in a commanding and accomplished performance', 'is also lovingly photographed', 'makes the most of a talented', 'is a well - crafted thriller', ""the end is deep all right , and there is n't a single shallow moment""]"

mcdonald is a newcomer and a promising
one at that , but gleeson has been in over a dozen movies , most recently as father bubbles in another film with a very irish accent on hilarity , "" the butcher boy .
""
even if you ca n't comprehend half of what they 're saying , gleeson and mcdonald together make "" i went down
"" a trip worth taking .
the film is in many ways reminiscent of another "" little "" independent feature , 1991 's "" highway 61 .
"" that film , too , was a road movie and it shares the same kind of wry dialogue and humorous situations
as mcpherson 's tale : whimsical observations on life , carefully - crafted vignettes , deadpan conversational asides , and scenes that 'll make you laugh out loud

witness the episode in which our good - natured protagonists bind frank ( played by peter caffrey ) to a hotel bed , leaving him with only the tv remote for company .
that sequence alone is on a par with satan locking himself out of his car in "" highway 61 .
""
what 's also charming about
"" i went down "" is how the relationship between buddy and git develops .
their trip becomes an education for both of them , but the way it 's handled is neither sappy nor labored .
the only thing in the film which approaches clunkiness is the culminating explanation , via flashbacks , of the relationship between frank and tom .
it 's a little too hollywood , and what makes "" i went down

"first , i am not a big fan of the x - files tv series .
i have nothing against it particularly , i just do n't happen to watch it .
having said that , i can now say that i liked the x - files pretty well
.
for us non - fans , there 's nothing big going for it , but there are a lot of little things .
the movie opens on an ice cave in north texas in 35 , 000 b . c .
two proto - humans enter the cave and find a space alien cocooned inside .
the alien breaks free and kills one man in a struggle while the other is seemingly captured by the bloody ooze from the alien .
the movie jumps to the same cave today where a boy ( lucas black , from sling blade ) is captured by the same black ooze .
we then cut to fbi agents scully and mulder ( gillian anderson and david duchovny ) , who have been pulled off of their previous assignment ( investigations into the paranormal ) and put onto the bomb squad detail .
a caller has threatened a federal building in dallas , texas .
on a hunch , mulder checks out the building across the street , and ,
would n't you know it , he turns out to be right .
the fbi finds the bomb in time to evacuate but not in time to defuse .
five people die in the blast , and when mulder learns who the victims were , a light bulb goes on over his head .
the two agents team up to investigate , against fbi orders , the links mulder has made .
their search leads them back to the north texas cave , all across the country , and even to antarctica as they get closer and closer to "" the truth .
""
the plot , and "" the truth , "" are uninspired .
i got the feeling that what i learned was supposed to shock and amaze me .
it did n't .
the possible existence of aliens on earth has been explored so many times before in movies that one could hardly count them .
but the point of the x - files is not what the truth is , but
the extent to which it has been hidden .
it 's a slightly more interesting angle , but it still raises expectations about that "" truth "" too high .
if this were the whole film , i would say the movie was mediocre , perhaps even boring .
but there are other qualities that make me like this movie
well enough to recommend it .
the pacing of the film was brisk enough to hold my interest . before the audience can get tired of one location , the agents follow a hot tip to another location , and so on and so forth .
the locations are not all computer - generated sets , either .
there are some artificial settings , but the desert night of nevada , the edge of suburbia in texas , and the endless fields of snow in antarctica ( actually somewhere in north america . ) make this fantastic film feel more real .
ward
russell 's cinematography is very good .
the overall look is dark and ominous , appropriate to the intended tone of the film 's plot .
russell is able to make something as innocuous as a cornfield look foreboding .
when the movie is set in darkness , the picture quality is still rich and detailed .
finally , and specifically , there is an incredible shot at night in which the camera crosses the tracks in front of a fast oncoming train .

.
the movie 's soundtrack is also used to convey the dark tone of the film .
( skip to the next paragraph if you have yet to see the movie - there is a spoiler in the following sentences . ) during the opening prehistoric sequence , a howling wind dogs the soundtrack , never giving the characters or the audience an escape from the lonely terrible sound .
in one of the movie 's most effective sequences , metallic doors suddenly slam open to release a cloud of buzzing bees .
the visuals of the scene are good , but what makes it so surprising and frightening is the sound .
there was no question as to who the movie 's stars would be .
even so , duchovny and anderson are an interesting pair of actors and a good combination .
both are easy on the eyes and together , they have some good timing , banter , and energy .
there is a hint of chemistry between them , but it never gets in the way of their professional relationship .
they are like a couple of kids out exploring the empty lot at the end of the street .
there might be some romantic interest , but for now they 're more interested in their environs than they are in each other .
no single element really makes this movie outstanding - not even the sense of paranoia that makes the tv show so popular . but enough things were done right that the x - files is one of the more interesting summer adventures to come along .",1,"['it looks great', 'cinematography is very good', 'good timing', 'i liked the x - files pretty well', 'an interesting pair of actors and a good combination', 'well enough to recommend', 'fantastic film feel more real', 'an incredible shot', 'one of the more interesting', 'pacing of the film was brisk enough to hold my interest', 'rich and detailed', 'enough things were done right']"
"everyone knows that old rule , ' never work with children and animals . ' in this latest horror flick mimic case , it 's ' never work with children and genetically enhanced killer animals ' instead , as mimic features both of these and succeeds in doing nothing except mildly engaging the audience .
the film begins in new york , where we see children dying from a mysterious disease , which is being carried by cockroaches .
dr .
susan tyler ( sorvino ) creates a genetically enhanced bug ( the ' judas ' breed ) , however , which is designed to kill all cockroaches .
the bug
does it 's job , the cockroaches all die , and the terror is gone . ' three years later ' appears on the screen , and we discover that the judas breed is back , bigger than ever , and ready to kill .
the spin on this bug , however , is that it can mimic it 's predator , and in this case . . . .
it 's humans .
that should teach us for squishing all those bugs .
what should be a roller coaster ride with bugs everywhere , tons of gory deaths and some massive set pieces instead turns out to be a rather subdued , almost boring movie which plods along at a very slow pace .
perhaps the movie was trying to be thought provoking , and trying to avoid the ' predator ' type movie it could easily have become .
if it is , then the director and writers have made the wrong move , because this is perfectly suited to be an all out action fest .
the director , who bought us cronos , a far superior film , directs the film in a calm , and frankly dull movie .
there are few exciting sequences , instead just a lot of people talking .
if the dialogue was intelligent , then it would be all right , but it 's sadly babbling nonsense
.
in fact , the script is embarrsingly weak , and the characterizations not much better .
sorvino and company are as 2d as characters come , with the script not bothering to develop them .
there is some action in this film , but it 's directed in such an annoying way , it 's just infuriating to watch .
the camera cuts all over the place , disoreitating the audience , and instead of involving the audience in the action , it merely alienates them .
the peformances are o .
k , if slightly below average .
sorvino is o .
k , although she 's not very good at conveying terror , or anything emotion really .
the supporting cast are all sterotypes , with characters such as a big black security guard with a foul mouth , a geeky scientist with spectacles , and what could be the most stereotypical mexican ' old timer ' ever .
their reasonable good fun , however .
mimic , then , may fail with it 's story , pacing and characters , but the film does look good .
like dark city , mimic is a definite case of style of content .
it may be a bit too gloomy for
it 's own good ,
but the sets look nice , and parts of the film are directed well .
but looks are n't good enough to save mimic from the depths of mediocre , somewhere where it should n't really belong .
a good opportunity , then , wasted .
a shame .

"i read the new yorker magazine and i enjoy some of their really in - depth articles about some incident .
they will take some incident like the investigation of a mysterious plane crash and tell you what happened in detail .
it becomes a real education in what agencies get involved and how theories are suggested , and what kind of pressure the investigators are under , and just about any other aspect you can think of .
frequently i get the feeling that the article sounded exciting , but i am being told in more detail than i really wanted to know .
often i get to the middle of a story and say , ok , it sounded good
but i now have invested more time than i am willing to spend on this subject .
film is a different medium .
it is a visual medium .
that slows down the telling of stories much more than people realize .
i frequently am surprised to find out how short a film script is and how much of the pages are empty space .
the magazine article and the film script are two very different media .
the insider is a film adaptation of the vanity fair article "" the man who knew too much "" by marie brenner .
it is too much an adaptation of a magazine article slowed to the pace of a film .
it really verges on being tedious at least at times
.
for years the seven big companies knew that they dealt in an addictive drug that caused a host of unhealthy side - effects .
but they pretended for the public that it was unproven and they did not really believe it .
the business was incredibly profitable and the proceeds translated into the political power to squelch and discredit any political movements against big tobacco .
the tide turned when a former vice - president of one of the companies was convinced by the cbs 60 minutes news team to tell the public how much the tobacco companies really knew about the health effects of smoking .
the resulting pressure to stop the story created a small civil war at cbs .
who were the major people involved , what were their motives , how was the story almost killed , how did it get aired anyway ?
that is the story covered in surprising detail by the insider .
this all could have been enthralling , but it is not the sort of thing that a stylist like michael mann would be likely to do well .
and in the end , he failed .
to make a long story short , the film needed a director who knew how to make a long story short .
the film opens with the cbs 60 minutes team in iran with the assignment to interview a terrorist .
we get a taste for their personal style and how they get the upper hand .
they go from being one newsman blindfolded at the hands of the terrorists to the actual interview with mike wallace ( played by christopher plummer ) .
there the news team under producer lowell bergman ( al pacino ) are ordering around the terrorists and getting away with it .
this seems to have nothing to do with the main line of the story , but later when the tobacco industry is so much harder to manipulate than committed terrorists , we have a wry irony on who really has clout in the world .
terrorists can grab the headlines , but the tobacco companies have the real position of power .
incongruously intercut with the iran interview sequence we see jeffrey wigand ( russell crowe ) dejectedly returning from work to his home .
we discover that he has been fired and his career brought to a complete halt unexpectedly .
he had been a very profitably rewarded vice - president in charge or research and development at brown and williams tobacco ; now he was unemployed and needed money to support his family . rather than support him his wife liane ( diane venora ) demands of him
what are they supposed to do for income .
meanwhile the 60 minutes team trying to do a story on fires started by cigarettes have obtained some data they do not understand .
they offer wigand $ 12 , 000 just to interpret the data .
wigand 's severance agreement swears him to secrecy about anything he knows about tobacco dealings , but he is reluctantly he stretches the severance terms .
he is willing to read some documents from another tobacco company and interpret them for bergman .
in spite of the secrecy , wigand 's former employers seem immediately to know wigand is talking to 60 minutes and he is warned off by former boss thomas sandefur played michael gambon in an all too brief but deliciously sinister role .
and so the game begins .
wigand is irate at his negative treatment for what he still considered continued to be loyalty to his agreement and his former employer .
meanwhile someone is playing very rough with wigand and his family .
the film examines wigand and the pressures placed on his family as they are caught between two powerful giants .
wigand has always wanted to make tobacco safer and has natural sympathies with getting the story out .
he and his family are assaulted psychologically and financially by the giant tobacco industry that had never lost a legal fight .
al pacino is given top billing but the wigand family is the core of the insider .
the story is told slowly and in just a bit too much meticulous detail .
the film is 157 minutes and is an extremely demanding film for the audience .
the musical score by pieter bourke , lisa gerrard , and graeme revell is one of the worst in recent memory .
it puts ominous chords under some scenes and using voice in ways that become a distraction that gets in the way of the storytelling .
also disturbing is the casting of christopher plummer as mike wallace .
plummer and wallace are such different types and wallace is too well - known for even so good an actor as plummer to play him convincingly .
this film might have been a really engaging experience under another director 's control .
michael mann was the wrong person to helm this film and the insider lacks intensity because of his style .
i rate it a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale .",0,"['was the wrong person to helm this film', 'and in the end , he failed .', 'too much an adaptation of a magazine article slowed to the pace of a film . it really verges on being tedious at least at times', 'become a distraction that gets in the way of the storytelling . also disturbing', 'lacks intensity because of his style', 'the story is told slowly and in just a bit too much meticulous detail . the film is 157 minutes and is an extremely demanding film for the audience', 'one of the worst in recent memory']"
"you know , i never really wondered what the tarzan films would have been like had tarzan been an old man .
while watching instinct , i could n't help but acknowledge the way the film carelessly rehashes the well - explored themes of those earlier movies .
even beside the tarzan comparison , instinct just is n't a very good film .
it 's painfully idealistic , manipulative , and silly .
i did n't hate it -- it 's simply impossible for me to hate any film starring anthony hopkins ; furthermore , most of the acting is quite good .
but i can recognize instinct for what it is beyond my subjective admiration for the actors involved .
i can also recognize reasons for wanting to make instinct , and it 's pretty clear that this could have been a good film with a massive script overhaul and a director less interested in imitating movies like patch adams .
things start off in the predictable way , as director jon turtletaub introduces us to our hero , theo caulder ( cuba gooding , jr . ) , an ambitious , young psychiatrist under the supervision of an experienced , old psychiatrist ( donald sutherland ) .
caulder soon finds himself involved in the case of his life , the one he thinks will make him famous .
the subject is ethan powell ( hopkins ) , an anthropologist who has been living among gorillas in africa for the past two years .
powell has been charged with the brutal murders of several men in africa , and it 's now caulder 's job to find out of he 's mentally competent enough to stand trial .
through a series of short sessions , caulder tries to put together the complex psyche of powell .
even though it really is an old man version of tarzan , much of this central idea is rather interesting .
as i said , hopkins is captivating for every second he 's on screen ; he has a way of convincing us that he 's not acting , that he 's actually a man who has just spent two years of his life living with a family of wild gorillas .
the character himself is n't very interesting -- he 's just an anthropologist who really likes gorillas -- but hopkins makes him interesting with subtleties both in speech and action .
gooding jr .
does strong work opposite hopkins , playing caulder as an intelligent and flawed individual .
the screenplay , written by gerald di pego and "" suggested by "" a novel by daniel quinn , gives us no background information on caulder , but that seems to be the point
( he has no time for friends because he 's obsessed with his work ) .
nonetheless , these two actors are essentially the entire list of things that are good about instinct .
unfortunately , filmmaking this inept can mangle the effect of even the best acting .
turtletaub and di pego are both guilty of instinct 's artistic failure , for they work together to make the dumbest , most cliche - ridden environment in which their characters are to live , and they do so by means of brainless subplots .
first , we have the prison warden subplot .
the prison warden is evil and wants to stop caulder 's progress at any cost ; if this means taking caulder off the powell case , then that 's fine .
there 's also the prison guard subplot .
the prison guard is played by john ashton ; the prison guard seems to enjoy mercilessly beating upon the psychotics under his supervision , and he 's instrumental in helping the story along to its obvious conclusion .
then there 's the daughter subplot , in which maura tierney ( playing the daughter ) must look very upset a lot of the time ; after all , she is the daughter of a deranged man .
if some of this stuff sounds familiar , that 's because they 're all devices that have been used and reused in countless other films .
the evil doctor in patch adams is not unlike the evil warden here .
the offensive caricatures of mental patients lack the depth that the similar portrayals in one flew over the cuckoo 's nest had .
ashton 's evil prison guard pales in comparison to clancy brown 's in the shawshank redemption .
hopkins ' performance will undoubtedly remind audiences of his turn in the silence of the lambs .
and then there 's the whole tarzan thing , which is more than a little bit obvious through the entire film .
perhaps what irritates me most about instinct is the half - hearted attempt at philosophical depth .
the message powell brings back from the wild is not a subtle one : he thinks that humans are "" takers , "" that they expand and kill and that we should all just live like gorillas .
i can sympathize with that , but only when it 's in a compelling film .
this is the kind of stupid movie -- just like patch adams -- in which a big group of characters ( psychotic inmates , in this case ) rise against the evil forces oppressing them by tearing up playing cards .
what does any of this have to do with a man who has just spent two years of his life with gorillas ?
if all the subplots of instinct had been left on the cutting room floor , we would have had a thirty - minute movie far superior to the two - hour one that i watched today .
if the central idea had been developed beyond the old man tarzan premise , then we would really have had something interesting -- a movie that does n't rely on the strength of its actors .",0,"['the offensive caricatures of mental patients lack the depth', 'pales in comparison', 'brainless subplots', 'this is the kind of stupid movie', 'the half - hearted attempt at philosophical depth', ""are both guilty of instinct 's artistic failure , for they work together to make the dumbest , most cliche - ridden environment"", 'carelessly rehashes', 'unfortunately , filmmaking this inept can mangle the effect of even the best acting', ""if some of this stuff sounds familiar , that 's because they 're all devices that have been used and reused in countless other films"", ""just is n't a very good film . it 's painfully idealistic , manipulative , and silly"", 'perhaps what irritates me most']"

he blows that chance when he invents "" flubber "" ( flying rubber ) and is so excited by his discovery that sara jean is once again awaiting him in her white dress .

it 's not all bad news .

everyone else comes across as half - asleep .

it feels like a bad disney movie from the sixties .

fred macmurray 's flying model t has been replaced by a t - bird .

the gloop has little arms and legs and splits into tiny little gloopettes for a big dance number .
this has nothing to do with the story .

not that contributing little to the plot is a big problem .

"i wish more films would take on issues of faith and morality in the modern world .
and i wish that film - makers would use commandments as a blueprint on how _ not _ to do it .
writer / director daniel taplitz has created a bizarre conglomeration of satire and soul - searching in this tale of seth warner ( aidan quinn ) , a man of faith who runs into a streak of bad luck which usually inspires country - western lyrics : his pregnant wife drowns , his home is destroyed by a tornado , he loses his job and his dog is crippled by a bolt of lightning .
convinced that god has broken his half of the covenant , seth decides to break his , and sets out to turn every "" thou shalt not "" of the ten commandments into a "" thou shalt "" ( and vice versa ) .
his wife 's sister rachel ( "" friends "" ' courteney cox ) wants to help seth ; rachel 's selfish husband harry ( anthony lapaglia ) , who tends to break a few commandments of his own , thinks seth is a lunatic .
thus begins a film which picks the wrong tone for every occasion .
taplitz is n't interested in treating seth 's tragedies as genuinely tragic , making it impossible to sympathize with him .
composer joseph vitarelli provides a score full of whimsical woodwinds , turning seth 's sacrilegious mission into an amusing lark ; quinn 's performance as seth is all wild - eyed fervor without any genuine pain .
the actual breaking of the commandments is almost treated as an afterthought , with one through five dispatched in a five - minute montage .
the result is a character whose actions feel less like the authentic responses of an anguished man than the machinations of a high - concept movie plot .
it 's not even entirely clear that commandments is about seth .
corporate attorney rachel is given a case which is supposed to soften a hard heart we see no indication she has , while harry gets his comeuppance as part of seth 's "" false witness .

only courteney cox strikes a note of reality in a solid performance ; she is sane center around which too equally troubled men revolve .
even she ca n't force taplitz to decide whose story this is , or what we should have learned about dealing with the struggles in our lives and our relationship with the infinite .
by the time seth makes a singularly biblical reappearance late in the film , it has become clear that taplitz is aiming for a fantastical fable which makes no connection with real human experience .

"there 's no reason to doubt that donnie brasco is based , as its opening credits proclaim , on a true story .
but if it 's an accurate picture of life on america 's mean streets , than cinematic depictions of organised crime have had a much stronger basis in reality than i would have previously thought .
for from the film 's outset , when a group of hoods jocularly trade differing opinions on the merits of various automobiles ( not unlike a number of movie lowlifes who recently gave a madonna song a close reading ) donnie brasco resembles more than passingly a few gangster flicks once believed to be works of fiction .
our eponymous hero ( johnny depp ) is not the cheap crook he first appears to be .
brasco is joseph pistone , an undercover fbi agent who has the task of chumming - up to lefty ( al pacino ) , a seasoned hood who tutors pistone in the art of being a "" wiseguy "" .
regrettably , pistone learns his lessons all too well .
his concern for lefty , who is burdened with a heroin addicted son , exacerbates his own family troubles : his children resent his lengthy absences and his wife fears that her husband 's gangster persona is becoming a little too convincing .
true , the focus on pistone 's family life does deviate from the typical gangster - flick formula , but this subplot never rises above its television drama origins .
the unhappy couple trade predictable lines and engage in drawn - out domestic squabbles ? including an ill - advised marriage guidance routine ?
that slow the film down unnecessarily . the biggest problem with donnie brasco , however , is that its wiseguy attitude and style lacks the flair of its many predecessors .
the awkward use of an occasional disco tune momentarily reminds us its the 70 's , but not with the consistent and blindingly tacky style ?
i loved those fluoro coloured suits ? of scorces ' costume drama casino .
more importantly , pacino 's presence triggers memories of his earlier movie triumphs in which similar territory was covered far more effectively .
donnie brasco 's take on american values , for instance , is feeble and obvious .
lefty rambles out dreams of material betterment to the accompaniment of grating inspirational music .
inexplicably , lefty 's horatio alger inspired gush is supposed to move us .
it does n't any more than his family troubles do , which are dealt in the same saccharine and obvious manner as pistone 's .
just think a minute on how these themes were explored in the godfather movies and scarface .
in these pictures pacino 's dedication to a peculiar and bloody hyper - capitalism was twisted and confronting , while his dogged application of macho wiseguy procedure meant that his relations to friends and family was intriguingly dark ?
neither were spared bloody retribution for breaching wiseguy regulations .
donnie brasco 's tawdry little crime , therefore is n't so much its repetition of familiar gangster themes , but
the shameless way in which it sanitises them .
( oh and by the way , i forgot to mention that the script also sports a startling subplot : pipstone 's superiors are obstructive incompetents who are infuriated by his constant insubordination ?
is that a "" damn you mcbain !
"" i hear from springfield way ? )
so
the movie is cliched .
big deal
, what do you expect from a gangster - flick ?
well you expect quality action sequences and bravado performances in abundance if its going to be a decent example of the genre .
donnie brasco fails on both counts .
the action scenes never rise above the ordinary and depp 's woeful performance tends to smother the good - work of his comrades .
admittedly , pacino does nothing new and michael madsen ( sonny ) simply smirks his way through the picture like a slightly subdued mr .
white , but both possess an unmistakable sly charm .
depp usually exhibits a bit of class himself , but regrettably , being in the presence of one of his betters must have left him star - struck , for he is completely hell - bent on mimicking pacino 's well - earned high style .
the consequences are painful to watch .
its no exaggeration to say that the film 's credibility is seriously strained by the sight of the pistone family 's uncanny ability to keep a straight face in front of their breadwinner 's phony brooklyn accent .
perhaps we should take pity on the makers of donnie brasco .
maybe a scrupulous adherence to pinpoint accuracy demanded tiered dialogue and scenarios weakly reminiscent of classic gangster flicks .
if this is indeed the case , surely the makers of donnie brasco could have explored the fascinating possibility that america 's underworld is committed to emulating , albeit in heavily attenuated form , their movie namesakes .
depp could have poignantly played a simple cop who becomes a hideous parody once he is forced to mimic big - screen gangster greats .
who knows what insights into the criminal psyche could have arisen ?
but then again , perhaps donnie brasco is n't so true after all .",0,"[""the action scenes never rise above the ordinary and depp 's woeful performance tends to smother the good - work of his comrades"", 'fails on both counts', 'the consequences are painful to watch', 'the biggest problem', ""the film 's credibility is seriously strained"", 'lacks the flair of its many predecessors', 'that slow the film down unnecessarily', 'the shameless way in which it sanitises them', 'the movie is cliched']"

the very fast - paced film stars mel gibson as jerry fletcher , a fast - talking , witty , comical taxi driver in new york city .
gibson 's performance is terrific , and his character is similar to that of martin riggs in the lethal weapon films .

to begin with , i was surprised at how good it was
.
do n't get me wrong , it 's not going to be accepting any gold trophies next spring , but it was a very enjoyable movie .
secondly , i was surprised at mel gibson 's performance .
he provided a fantastic performance .
the previews of this film led me to believe it was an all - out action flick , which after viewing , it was almost the opposite in a certain sense .
gibson 's character has an almost uncountable number of one - liners , hilarious situations , and his character is one that the audience tends to side with throughout the film .
for instance , jerry 's apartment ( and especially his security ) is memorable .
and last , i was surprised at how good the plot is .
writer brian helgeland has created a terrific story , and when watching this film , you are left to wonder if all of jerry fletcher 's far - fetched ( or so they seem at first )
conspiracy theories are helgeland 's own opinions .
mel gibson is n't the only stand - out in the film .
julia roberts is very good in her performance as alice sutton , the department of justice employee who ca n't seem to stay away from jerry fletcher , who continually visits alice in hopes that she will do something about his theories .
he also seems obsessed and in love with her .
but whenever he approaches her with another one of his theories , she shrugs him and his beliefs off , continually noting that one day she is going to slap a restraining order on him .
jerry , obviously determined to continually seek out the truth , continues to research information for his next conspiracy theory , which will be printed in his newsletter ( same title as the movie ) .
although he only has five subscribers , he puts a large amount of time and effort into his work , and publishes his next edition .
very soon after he does so , he is abducted and tortured by a sinister man who refers to himself as dr .
jonas ( patrick stewart ) .
after barely escaping alive , jerry is forced to turn to the only person he can trust : alice sutton .
the remainder of the film is almost always fast - paced and full of action and suspense , with jerry 's life being constantly put into jeopardy .
and more along the way , the audience ( and alice ) learn more and more about jerry 's life .
many things are explained throughout this film , both to the characters and to the audience .
for instance , the meaning of the book "" the catcher in the rye "" and its ties to assassins , the reason lone gunmen have three names ( e . g .
lee
harvey oswald and james earl ray ) , and the real truth behind the grateful dead .
make sure listen closely throughout the film , as jerry is constantly throwing out interesting tidbits such as the above .
definitely , when conspiracy theory hits theaters august 8th
, make sure you are standing in line to see it .
i am nearly positive everyone should enjoy this film , especially if you are into an action - thriller with witty dialogue and numerous suspenseful situations .
and even if you are n't , you should still like this film .",1,"['everyone should enjoy this film', 'is very good in her performance', 'the combination works even better', 'you should still like this film', 'how good the plot is', 'performance is terrific', 'created a terrific story', 'is indeed unique', 'a * very good * movie', 'a fantastic performance', 'the only stand - out', 'full of action and suspense', 'how good it was', 'hilarious situations', 'a very enjoyable movie', 'make sure you are standing in line to see it']"
""" party camp , "" is one of the most mindnumbingly brainless comedies i 've seen in awhile .
a late rip - off of the "" meatballs "" series , the film follows a group of young camp counselors at camp chipmunk .
that 's really about all that can be said about the "" plot "" because nothing much happens , except
that the main character , wise - cracking jerry ( andrew ross ) , has the hots for a cute blonde ( kerry brennan ) , and there is a big contest in the climax .
how fun !
since , "" party camp , "" has practically no screenplay and there is no talent at all involved , the least the makers could have done was make it raunchy and exploitative .
it 's not that i think exploitation is necessarily a good quality , but when you are talking about a dull turkey like this , the least that could have been done would be to fill it with a lot of mindless sex .
even a psychopathic slasher at the camp would have done the trick .
at least , then , it would n't have been such a chore to sit through .
never before have i seen so many jokes fall astoundingly flat .
the comedy was easy to spot , but it was n't the least bit funny .
it was groan - inducing .
constantly throghout , i was asking myself if director gary graver actually thought this movie was worth anything .
so what saves , "" party camp , "" from the dreaded zero star rating ?
well , that 's simple :
jewel shepard , as a flighty bimbo , was admittedly fun to watch .
although nothing could have saved this film from the lowest depths of motion picture trash , at least if the film had centered on shepard , she might have been able to add a little spice to an otherwise rancid , low - budget teen comedy .",0,"['no talent at all', 'rancid , low - budget', 'rip - off', 'nothing much happens', 'practically no screenplay', 'so many jokes fall astoundingly flat', 'groan - inducing', 'the most mindnumbingly brainless', 'nothing could have saved this film from the lowest depths of motion picture trash', ""it was n't the least bit funny""]"
"it happens every year -- the days get longer , the weather gets warmer and the studios start releasing their big - budget blockbusters .
this year 's crop already seems inferior to that of past summers , even 1997 's lackluster trio of batman & robin , the fifth element and the lost world .
the marketing blitz in 1998 has been centered on godzilla ( "" heeere , lee - zerd , lee - zerd . . . "" ) , which does n't make me optimistic about future summers .
godzilla is , of course , based on a series of cult movies ( translation : really bad movies only a few people can tolerate ) from japan that turn up really late at night on ted turner - owned cable stations .
that this big - budget remake wo n't rise above its roots is fairly obvious .
the credits show us the origin of godzilla .
in five words : nuclear explosion creates giant lizard .
sounds like an enquirer headline , does n't it ?
the mushroom cloud is followed by the inevitable "" discovery "" sequence .
this time , a japanese guy is eating noodles with chopsticks while watching sumo wrestling ( if that ai n't a stereotype . . . )
when he discovers the telltale radar blip .
people die .
cut to our protagonist , played by matthew broderick .
he makes his first appearance wearing headphones , warbling along to "" singin ' in the rain .
""
it 's a none - too - subtle sign that he wishes he were in a classier movie .
no dice , bueller .
from the beginning , poor matthew has to do embarassing things like fondle giant earthworms and stand in godzilla 's enormous footprint .
every disaster movie has to have a know - it - all scientist , and this time broderick is it .
as the world 's leading expert on radiated earthworms ( and would n't you love to have that printed on your business card ? ) , broderick is invaluable to the government .
he immediately dispels vicki lewis ' theory that godzilla is a dinosaur because , hey , you ca n't take seriously the intellectual arguments of "" newsradio "" cast members .
broderick instead hits the nail on the head , announcing godzilla is a radiated lizard .
""
the radiation is n't an anamoly , "" he announces , and lightning strikes .
""
i believe this is a mutated abberation , "" he continues , and lightning strikes again .
it 's vocabulary lightning , you see ,
activated by words of four syllables or more .
meanwhile , we 're introduced to our new york cast , headed by an ambitious broadcast journalist ( maria patillo ) , broderick 's former love .
gee , what are the odds their paths will cross again at a dramatically important time ?
poor patillo has been trying to get ahead in the news business for years but has been held down by heartless anchorman harry shearer .
italian cameraman hank azaria tells her she 's not ruthless enough : "" nice does n't get you anywhere in this town .
it 's dog eat dog .
""
actually , it 's lizard eat city , as godzilla emerges from the atlantic to begin a rampage on the big apple 's core .
the filmmakers provide us with a one - note drunk fisherman who hooks godzilla .
""
i think i 've got a bite , "" he announces as a gigantic tidal wave begins rushing toward him .
you can guess what happens next .
similar reactions spring forth as the monster prowls the city .
hearing the rumble of approaching footsteps , one new yorker remarks , "" please do n't tell me that 's another parade .
"" please do n't tell me that 's the best line you could come up with .
mayor ebert is not pleased . played by the principal from "" head of the class , "" he continually makes the wrong decision when given an option , and bickers with his assistant gene .
i guess the filmmakers knew they 'd be getting two thumbs down from the critics and did n't even bother to kiss ass .
the problem is , if you 're going to attack siskel and ebert , you should at least make it funny .
dialogue like , "" did n't we agree that we were n't going to have any sweets until after the election ?
"" followed by , "" back off , gene , "" just does n't work for me .
other lame running jokes include everyone mispronouncing the broderick character 's last name and frenchman jean reno 's inability to find a good cup of coffee in new york .
there 's even more fun to be had as godzilla progresses .
as the beast heads back into hiding , broderick suggests the military lure it out with food .
cue twelve dump trucks , all dropping fish into a new york intersection .
( broderick :
that 's a lot of fish . )
that ambush fails , but broderick soon figures out why godzilla came to new york by buying $ 50 worth of home pregnancy tests and running lizard blood through them .
yep , godzilla 's with children , which makes you wonder just what kind of creature would be horny enough to have sex with godzilla .
that 's until broderick explains that godzilla reproduces asexually , like linda tripp .
godzilla comes to us from the makers of independence day , so
it has a lot of dumb action scenes , destructive special effects and shallow subplots .
look no further than patillo 's betrayal of broderick
( patillo : what have i done , animal ?
what have i become ? ) and the climactic "" godzilla 's nest "" sequence in madison square garden .
the main difference is , independence day was about the experience .
it had a real global , patriotic element to it , and some genuinely fun characters .
godzilla has lots of rain and lightning , reptilian action ripped off from jurassic park and endless product placement from the likes of kodak , blockbuster , juicy fruit , swatch , sprint and bumble bee tuna .
yes , bumble bee actually paid to be known as the official tuna of godzilla .
that fact alone is twice as interesting as anything in the movie .",0,"['activated by words of four syllables or more', 'lightning strikes', 'other lame running jokes', 'poor matthew has to do embarassing things', ""please do n't tell me that 's the best line you could come up with"", 'gee , what are the odds', 'it has a lot of dumb action scenes , destructive special effects and shallow subplots', 'endless product placement']"
"it 's a rare treat when a quality horror film is released in the theater .
and unfortunately with man 's best friend , we 'll be waiting a while longer .
the film stars ally sheedy and lance henrikson in a tale of bio - genetics gone wrong .
sheedy plays a nosy reporter whose need for a "" good "" story provokes her to snoop inside of emax , a poorly guarded million dollar bio - lab that she finds herself effortlessly intruding .
the result : she unleashes the experimental wonder dog named max , a german shepherd with genetic recombination allowing it to swallow like a snake , camouflage like a chameleon , climb trees like a leopard , and attack with the strength of tiger .
max takes a liking to sheedy , and she finds herself protecting the animal from the cruel technological realm of emax , owned by henrikson .
well , it does n't take long before the hormonally unstable biohazard unleashes his jowls upon the unsuspecting suburban landscape which offers max juicy leg of mailman , etc . . .

henrikson offered the only relief from the contrived narration of the script , giving his character as much development as he could considering the flat dialogue plaguing the film .

"arnold schwarzenegger has been an icon for action enthusiasts , since the late 80 's , but lately his films have been very sloppy and the one - liners are getting worse
.
it 's hard seeing arnold as mr .
freeze in batman and robin , especially when he says tons of ice jokes ,
but hey he got 15 million , what 's it matter to him ?
once again arnold has signed to do another expensive blockbuster , that ca n't compare with the likes of the terminator series , true lies and even eraser .
in this so called dark thriller , the devil ( gabriel byrne ) has come upon earth , to impregnate a woman ( robin tunney ) which happens every 1000 years , and basically destroy the world , but apparently god has chosen one man , and that one man is jericho cane ( arnold himself ) .
with the help of a trusty sidekick ( kevin pollack ) , they will stop at nothing to let the devil take over the world !
parts of this are actually so absurd , that they would fit right in with dogma .
yes , the film is that weak , but it 's better than the other blockbuster right now ( sleepy hollow ) , but it makes the world is not enough look like a 4 star film .
anyway , this definitely does n't seem like an arnold movie .
it just was n't the type of film you can see him doing .
sure he gave us a few chuckles with his well known one - liners , but he seemed confused as to where his character and the film was going .
it 's understandable , especially when the ending had to be changed according to some sources .
aside form that
, he still walked through it , much like he has in the past few films .
i 'm sorry to say this arnold but
maybe these are the end of your action days .
speaking of action , where was it in this film ?
there was hardly any explosions or fights .
the devil made a few places explode , but arnold was n't kicking some devil butt .
the ending was changed to make it more spiritual , which undoubtedly ruined the film .
i was at least hoping for a cool ending if nothing else occurred , but once again i was let down .
i also do n't know why the film took so long and cost so much .
there was really no super affects at all , unless you consider an invisible devil , who was in it for 5 minutes tops , worth the overpriced budget .
the budget should have gone into a better script , where at least audiences could be somewhat entertained instead of facing boredom .
it 's pitiful to see how scripts like these get bought and made into a movie .
do they even read these things anymore ?
it sure does n't seem like it .
thankfully gabriel 's performance gave some light to this poor film .
when he walks down the street searching for robin tunney , you ca n't help but feel that he looked like a devil .
the guy is creepy looking anyway !
when it 's all over , you 're just glad it 's the end of the movie .
do n't bother to see this , if you 're expecting a solid action flick , because it 's neither solid nor does it have action .
it 's just another movie that we are suckered in to seeing , due to a strategic marketing campaign .

"those print and television ads trumpeting that "" ' grease ' is still the word "" are right on the money .
to celebrate its 20th anniversary , this quintessential movie musical is getting the royal treatment reserved for classics like "" star wars "" -- a well - deserved , red - carpet rerelease .
that 's fantastic , especially when considering of all the classic characters and scenes the film has served up -- who can forget aspiring beautician frenchie ( didi conn ) being serenaded by her tell - it - like - it - is guardian angel ( frankie avalon ) ? or the hard - nosed principal ( eve arden ) reminding the student body to "" be an athletic supporter "" by rooting for the home team ? or national bandstand emcee vince fontaine ( edd byrnes ) flirting with marty ( a pre- "" empty nest "" dinah manhoff ) ?
and these are all probably considered minor moments . . .
a very skinny john travolta and a very young olivia newton - john have the respective leads of danny zuko and sandy olsson , and their pairing still ranks as one of screendom 's most effervescently charming .
for those eight of you who are n't familiar with the story , here 's a brief recap : greaser bad boy danny and aussie good girl sandy are reunited for their 1959 senior year at rydell high after a brief fling during the summer ; both thought she was going to return to her native continent before school started , but both were wrong .
sandy tries to rekindle their relationship , but danny 's too cool a cat to fall for her wholesome appeal in front of his t - bird buddies ( including jeff conaway ) .
so sandy hooks up with a gang herself -- the pink ladies , headed by sassy , sexy rizzo ( stockard channing , just superb as an independent woman well ahead of her time ) -- and danny , who still really feels love for her , attempts a compromise of ideals in order to win her back .
the drag race finale is yet something of a drag , and i never have thought much of "" greased lightening , "" the film 's big "" guy "" number ( that choreography -- ack ! ) , but "" grease "" 's flaws amount too few to carp .
the movie 's first showpiece is "" summer nights , "" where danny and sandy separately recount wildly different versions of their fun - in - the - sun romance .
not only is "" nights "" tremendously catchy , but it 's also a smart look at how men and women see the same events with varying eyes .
there has yet to be a live - action musical sequence that rivals the one - two punch of
"" you 're the one that i want "" and "" we go together ,
"" "" grease "" 's euphoric cappers .
all this and
some of the most pleasing moments come from the smaller , quieter moments ; the oscar - nominated "" hopelessly devoted to you "" is a lovely showcase for newton - john , and channing 's lamenting ballad "" there are worse things i could do "" is one of "" grease "" 's most unjustly overlooked tunes .
the soundtrack is remastered ( though travolta still hits that awful high note at the end of "" nights "" ) and the restored widescreen allows us to see previously pan - and - scanned - out choreography , but nothing else has changed -- no computer - generated backgrounds , no outtakes or new musical numbers , no jabba the hutt cameos .
and it 's a testament to "" grease "" 's timeless success that nothing needs to be changed -- it 's the same all - around blast
it 's always been , with an appealing cast in a fun story told with great music .
to ' 90s viewers , "" grease "" will probably recall disco and bellbottoms as much as it made its original audience nostalgic for doo - wop and poodle skirts .
but regardless of what decade it transports us to , we can all agree on one thing -- without a doubt , "" grease "" is still the word .",1,"['a smart look', 'all - around blast', 'tremendously catchy', 'timeless success', 'an appealing cast in a fun story told with great music', 'superb', 'some of the most pleasing moments', 'a well - deserved , red - carpet rerelease']"
"ingredients : lost parrot trying to get home , friends synopsis : a russian janitor named misha ( tony shalhoub ) discovers a little old parrot languishing in the basement of a science research facility .
"" paulie the talking parrot "" ( the voice of jay mohr ) soon regales misha with his life story .
as a young bird paulie is raised by marie ( hallie kate eisenberg ) , a little girl with a speech impediment .
by attending marie 's speech lessons , paulie learns to act / speak like a regular person .
unfortunately , after being unfairly blamed for an accident , paulie is taken to a pawn shop and sold .
paulie 's biggest wish is to return to marie .
many years later , and after a succession of memorable owners ( gena rowlands , cheech marin , and jay mohr ) , paulie falls in with a bad crowd and is apprehended in los angeles trying to steal jewelry .
he is sent to a cruel research facility , where he refuses to participate and is imprisoned the basement .
will misha help paulie get back to marie ?
opinion :
every time people watch movies that portray animals as beings with cute human personalities , some well - meaning audience members go out next christmas or birthday and buy a dalmatian or whatever creature is currently popular .
soon enough , "" birthday kid "" loses interest and the purchased pup ends up at the local pound , a victim of neglect .
my sister owns a real paulie : it thinks like a parrot , bites like a parrot , and requires as much attention as a newborn human infant .
please think twice before buying one .
okay .
back to the story .
in movies , parrots usually play support characters , but paulie might be the first movie where the ( animatronic ) bird gets main billing .
paulie , like those side characters in disney cartoons , is cute and sassy , a strutting , miniature human .
actually , paulie is the voice of jay mohr ( he played jennifer aniston 's boyfriend on picture perfect ) doing his best buddy hackett impression ( which is interesting , since hackett himself cameos as the pawn shop owner , and mohr doubles as a customer ) .
paulie is for kids .
while watching paulie you hear little tykes in the theater laughing hysterically when paulie calls the cat a "" stupid furball .
"" sometimes , however , there are statements the kids do n't get .
for example , when paulie 's elderly owner ivy ( gena rowlands )
dies , paulie explains , "" well , one day , the cat got her .
""
and you hear kids exclaim , "" what cat ? !
"" imagine lassie come home , except with a doll - sized human dressed as a bird , and you 'll have a good idea of the plot and characterization .
bird tries to get home .
bird meets elderly friend .
bird loses elderly friend .
bird meets eccentric friend .
bird loses eccentric friend .
bird meets bad influence .
and so on and so forth , with paulie meeting friends and saying goodbye at a meandering pace until he finally makes it back to marie ( trini alvarado ) .
the bottom line ? break out the popcorn money , moms and dads .
paulie may be the low end version of lassie , bambi , or babe , but he 'll do .
sometimes the wisecracks go over their heads , but i 'm sure youngsters can appreciate a story about a little person ( paulie ) trying to get home , meeting friends and experiencing moral lessons on the way .
and good luck explaining what it means when paulie says of ivy , "" well , one day , the cat got her . """,1,"['break out the popcorn money , moms and dads', 'laughing hysterically', 'cute and sassy']"
"often similar to a little boy lost in a park that he had no right venturing into , the call of the oboe ( o toque do oboe ) is a disappointing film that seems to have wandered astray .
many elements of the film are solid , and have potential far greater than director claudio macdowell will ever know , but they simply do n't convert into a solid work .
although a setting is never established , it becomes apparent .
the film takes place somewhere in a latin american village in present day .
the community is a dull one , where every day is a downhill slide from the last .
over time , the people have taken to themselves .
the town cinema is closed , no tourist has passed through in years , and the daily funeral processions are accompanied by no one other than the grave digger .
so what happens when a "" tourist "" ( paolo betti ) does arrive one day ?
he sends this routine and dull town into mayhem and shock .
it is revealed that he is a musician who plays the oboe as a hobby .
when he sits down in the park one day to give a solo performance , the entire community gathers around for their first bit of entertainment in countless years .
it is from that that the musician meets some of the villagers , and agrees to play at the local cinema in accompaniment to a silent film , thus opening the theatre for the first time in ages .
the woman that talks him into this witty task is the cinema owner ( leticia vota ) who also happens to be engaged to the town 's police inspector , a figure who soon becomes suspicious of his fiance 's involvement with this musician .
the rest of the plot closely resembles a freak show gone horribly astray
.
it features a character who literally rises from his grave , a woman who has a phone conversation with god , and the aforementioned inspector who goes from an intriguing and serious character , to an almost humorous drunk .
technically , this film is a nightmare .
the music score is poorly edited into the film , so it is often choppy , rough , and abrupt .
the lighting is poor at best , which makes it increasingly difficult to focus on many scenes , and the english subtitles are full of misspelled words , and are often absent presumably on the assumption that the audience will be able to understand some simple portuguese and spanish phrases .
this translation flaw is best highlighted at the beginning of the film when what seems to be a relevant fight is filled with dialogue , but the subtitles are limited to fewer than 25 words .
in addition , the pace of the film seems uneven .
it opens with a series of long panoramic shots that alone
can test one 's patience .
the film then moves into a faster pace , that again slows towards the end , as the director seems determined to reach the two hour mark .
there was , however , potential for this film .
it is a piece exploring the beauty of cinema and music , and the re - unification of people .
these are all topics that could easily fill a movie .
perhaps , if there were no freak show , and the technical aspects were to improve , there might just be a thing of beauty at the end .
most importantly , though , the director would have to patch up the plot and make it flow better so that the two hours are n't such a bore
.
until then , there seems to be little more hope for this piece , than that boy has by simply crying out "" mommy "" while he wanders astray in a park .",0,"[""can test one 's patience"", 'this translation flaw', 'the rest of the plot closely resembles a freak show gone horribly astray', 'such a bore', 'poorly edited', 'a disappointing film that seems to have wandered astray', 'technically , this film is a nightmare', 'the lighting is poor at best', 'the pace of the film seems uneven']"
"contact is a nobly intentioned but ultimately unsatisfying adaptation of carl sagan 's only novel .
it details the circumstances surrounding the first clear sign of intelligent life in outer space and their effects on the life of a young and idealistic radio astronomer named ellie arroway ( jodie foster ) .
we first meet ellie at a giant radio telescope in puerto rico , where she is part of the seti ( search for extraterrestrial intelligence ) project .
her research is quickly killed , however , by her highly political david drumlin ( tom skerrit ) , who disdains "" pure research "" in favor of science with "" commercial applications .
she goes in search of private funding and is turned down at every step until she pitches her project to a corporation run by the mysterious s .
r .
hadden ( john hurt ) .
then , with that money just about to finally dry up , ellie is sitting out in the desert near the very large array in new mexico when she hears over her headphones a very powerful pulsing radio signal .
in the movie 's most exciting and believable sequence , ellie and her coworkers determine that the signal has to be coming from the star vega .
at first the signal appears to be just sequences of prime numbers , then it turns out to be a tv signal of the berlin olympics bounced back to earth from 50 years before .
further decoding , with hadden 's help , reveals another layer to message , containing detailed plans for a massive and complex machine .
it appears that the machine is a transport that will allow one person to travel to the aliens ' home world .
of course , the big question becomes "" who gets to ride it ?
"" ( right after "" who 's gon na pay for this thing ? "" ) . to boil it down , ellie gets denied the seat in the machine because she bluntly acknowledges her atheism , while drumlin gets to go because he rather insincerely professes his deep religious faith .
drumlin is killed and the machine destroyed when religious fanatics bomb the launch platform ( apparently to keep "" godless science "" from talking to god , or something like that ) .
then hadden reappears with startling news .
he has secretly constructed a second machine off the coast of japan and has reserved the ride for ellie , in whom he has taken a rather paternal interest .
ellie boards
the machine and is transported through some kind of wormhole to a dream - like place that looks a lot like waikiki beach before they built the hotels , where she meets the aliens who take the form of her late father ( david morse ) .
when she returns home , no one believes her .
she was not even gone for one second , they say , even though she remembers being gone for 18 hours .
her story is officially discredited , although believed by a large segment of the public ( who do n't even have to know that her computer records of the trip contain nothing but static . . .
eighteen hours worth of static ) .
there is a lot to like about contact
so i will highlight those points first .
ellie arroway is a well - rounded character portrayed by one of the best actresses currently working .
neither the character nor the performance has the same depth as clarice starling in silence of the lambs , but that 's a tough standard to meet .
ellie is interesting in that she is woman defined by a strange array of father figures .
her real father is an idealized movie dad who does nothing in the film but love his daughter unconditionally .
drumlin comes across as a distant stepfather to whom ellie is like an irritating teenager who wants to use his toys to get into trouble .
hadden obviously has affection for ellie , but in the end he seems to see her as his creation , nothing more than his favorite piece on the chess board .
even palmer joss ( matthew mcconaughey ) , ellie 's love interest , takes a paternalistic interest in ellie , seeing her as a misguided person who needs protection from her own impulses .
the film is technically impressive , especially in the scenes where the message is first received and during the destruction of the first machine .
the part of the film dealing with the message has the best presentation of real science in a film since the andromeda strain .
the film falls apart when dealing with its central theme , the dichotomy between science and religion .
this is a very real debate but contact boils it down to a simplistic level that never really touches on the actual issues involved .
the film presents science pretty well ( until the end ) so the real problem stems from it presentation of religious faith .
religious people are presented as shallow caricatures .
rob lowe plays a ralph reed clone named richard rank ( very subtle , guys ) , the voice of the religious right .
another religious figure is the fanatic who blows up the first machine ( jake busey ) .
the only really fleshed - out religious person , palmer joss , is supposed to be a minister of some sort , but his actual faith is left pretty vague .
i ca n't even say for certain that he was supposed to be a christian .
all we know is that he dropped out of the seminary and obviously has no qualms about pre - marital sex .
the film drops the science ball at the very end , when ellie appears to assert that there are some things even scientists must take on faith .
in a day and age when the theory of evolution is denounced by the religion right as an atheist "" religious "" doctrine , this is exactly the wrong message to send .
in a movie dealing with issues of science and faith , the last thing you want your scientist character to do is abandon the principle of scientific skepticism .
what ellie should have said was , "" you should n't believe me . not without evidence , and i do n't have the evidence .
i know what happened
but you should n't take my word alone .
""
that is the voice of science speaking .
the character of david drumlin is another problem with this film .
his attitudes toward pure research project seem out of place for a person in his position .
also , his profession of "" faith "" before the selection committee is so nakedly and transparently insincere that only a pack of idiots should have fallen for it .
the last big problem is with the use of real personalities in various roles .
the media figures , such as bernard shaw and jay leno are n't so bad , in as much as their participation was voluntary .
the use of bill clinton , however , should give anyone pause .
first of all , lifting the image of a sitting head of state and inserting him into a fictional story line , thus using his words outside of the context in which they were spoken , is just plain creepy .
also , using the real president places this film between 1993 and 2001 , forever dating it .
people watching this film in the future will say , "" hey , this never took place during clinton 's term .
"" this bit of unreality will jar people out of their suspension of disbelief . also , the level of technology portrayed in the film is too advanced to take place before the first decade of the next century .
better to have had a fictitious president played by an actor or no president at all .
the film does raise an interesting question , although it never develops it in a satisfying way . if we were picking an emissary to send to an alien culture , would an atheist be automatically disqualified just because ninety percent of the population of the world professes a belief in god , or at least some form of supernatural creator ?

"warner brothers ; rated pg-13 ( mild violence , sexual situations ) ; 132 minutes director : luis mandoki screenplay : gerald di pego ( from the novel by nicholas sparks ) cast : kevin costner , robin wright - penn , paul newman , illeana douglas , robbie coltrane , jesse james , john savage .
review by :
geoff berkshire
i 'm not an overly cynical guy .
there have been many glossy hollywood romances that have carried me away with their romanticism over the years .
however , i have my limits and i also have standards .
this brings us to the subject at hand : message in a bottle , the big ticket romance that warner brothers ' unleashed upon the movie going public just in time for valentine 's day .
the story , what little of it that there is , involves boring chicago tribune reporter theresa osborne ( robin wright - penn ) dealing with her recent divorce and trying to raise her young son jason ( jesse james ) .
during a brief stay somewhere in new england she finds the titular message in a bottle while on a morning run by the ocean .
the letter , written to a mystery woman named catherine , instantly captivates her .
upon her return , theresa shares it with her best friend lina ( illeana douglas ) , her boss charlie ( robbie coltrane ) , and the entire city of chicago ( the newspaper publishes an article about it ) .
it turns out that the message was written by grieving widower garret blake ( kevin costner ) and so theresa travels to north carolina and tracks him down .
he turns out to have a colorful father ( paul newman ) but is otherwise perfectly dull and overly obsessed with sailing .
this is somehow attractive to theresa and the two begin their awkward courtship .
of course she does n't tell him that she found his letter , she wants to but the rules of this type of film require him to find out later ( preferably right after they first make love ) .
this way garret can get very angry and the relationship can be threatened .
the discovery of the message and garret 's discovery that theresa discovered the message are really the only two noteworthy events that happen during the nearly two and a quarter hour running time of this film .
there 's a truly lame subplot about garret 's relationship with his dead wife 's family ( he gets into a bar fight with her brother , played by john savage ) and then the necessary tear - jerking ending .
a fun way to pass the time is to take bets on exactly who will die , although it becomes pretty clear by the second reel .
the actual death sequence is one of the most ridiculously forced , and unintentionally humorous , sequences filmed since .
. .
well , since costner 's the postman ( 1997 ) .
message in a bottle is one slow moving film .
last year audiences were offered endurance tests such as the horse whisperer and meet joe black but both of those films resemble jerry bruckheimer productions next to this .
they also had redeeming qualities in the form of quality performances and some stand out technical work .
message in a bottle has a decent enough cast but they 're fighting the material all the way , and losing badly .
costner and , especially , wright - penn are both likable and attractive enough to cheer for but their characters are simply too boring .
they also fail to generate any kind of real romantic chemistry .
the supporting players are given very little to do .
the reliable douglas is particularly wasted .
old pro newman gives his all and occasionally threatens to kick some life into this dead horse of a film .
a confrontational scene he has with costner near the end is especially well played .
however , too frequently he just reminds us how unexciting our lead characters are .
the film is very polished on the technical side to be sure but it only works to undercut the story .
gabriel yared , who previously set the romantic moods of the english patient ( 1996 ) and city of angels ( 1998 ) with his scores , overdoes it a bit here .
caleb deschanel 's camera makes everything look a little too beautiful .
do the offices of the chicago tribune really need to look heavenly ?
the editing by steven weisberg is troubling not only considering all that could have been cut out but is also simply messy at times .
the real offender here is screenwriter
gerald di pego .
working from a best- selling novel by nicholas sparks ( which i have not read but have been told is on the same literary level as the bridges of madison county ) , di pego creates one of the most uninspired scripts of recent times .
its strict adherence to clich ?
s brings to mind such disasters as i still know what you did last summer ( 1998 ) .
there simply is n't an original scene in this film .
the dialogue is rarely better than laughable and this is only accentuated by the excessively long pauses every character takes while speaking .
this is director mandoki 's first film since when a man loves a woman ( 1994 ) , the solid meg ryan / andy garcia romance .
he 's simply going through the motions with this .
message in a bottle is easily the worst of the several romantic offerings available in theaters at the moment and vies with what dreams may come ( 1998 ) as one of the most misguided romances of the decade .",0,"['one of the most uninspired scripts', ""they 're fighting the material all the way , and losing badly"", ""there simply is n't an original scene in this film . the dialogue is rarely better than laughable"", ""there 's a truly lame subplot"", 'their characters are simply too boring . they also fail to generate any kind of real romantic chemistry', 'excessively long pauses', 'particularly wasted', 'the real offender here is screenwriter', 'easily the worst of the several romantic offerings', 'one slow moving film', 'one of the most misguided romances of the decade', 'one of the most ridiculously forced , and unintentionally humorous , sequences filmed', 'dead horse of a film']"
"capsule : godawful "" comedy
"" that 's amazingly shabby and cut - rate , and rather bereft of laughs
.
i was having a bad week in my life when i saw austin powers :
international man of mystery .
i desperately needed something to cheer me up , or at least distract me so i could get a clear head .
get some perspective .
even dumb movies can do that for me , sometimes .
i tried hard not to let my dejection affect my judgment , but i am certain now that austin powers would have also sucked rocks through bamboo shoots on the day i won the lottery .
michael myers has taken a character that would barely have supported a five - minute sketch on saturday night live and stretched it to the length of a feature film , padding it out with toilet jokes and the sort of props - strategically - positioned - between - naked - actors - and - camera gags that benny hill got tired of fifteen years ago .
the plot , what little there is of it : back in the swinging mod hep sixties ( i do n't think i 'm doing a disservice to the movie 's attempted early look and feel by describing it that way ) , sexy british secret agent austin powers tangled with his nemesis dr .
evil .
evil launched himself into orbit and cryogenically forze himself to return decades later , when powers was out of the picture .
powers also had himself frozen , and he wakes up to find the nineties a very hard time to deal with .
the basic gag , that of powers ' total inability to cope with the nineties , is not so much exhausted during the course of the movie as never even really dealt with .
the bulk of the movie is taken up with dumb jokes of several basic rubrics : james bond gags ( of which this movie has no end , right down to the silly character names ) , inept slapstick , toilet humor , and strategically placed props . . .
the movie 's amazingly bereft of ideas , come to think of it , with a couple of bright exceptions .
one is dr .
evil 's son -- there is a sidesplitting scene where father and son go to an encounter group , chaired by carrie fisher -- and the other is a throwaway gag where austin mimics various forms of transportation from behind a couch ( it 's a visual gag -- hard to describe , and hard to recommend seeing the movie for ) .
a lot of sixties kitsch has been resurrected and thrown on the screen for this movie , but it 's desperate rather than clever .
instead of skewering the whole thing , it 's a rather bloodless and unfunny tribute
.
myers himself is also desperate : he 's given an idea to play , not a character .
plus , the attempts to make the character work by giving him a relationship with another sexy ( albeit "" nineties "" ) agent are a waste of time .
i wanted to have the movie end with him trying yet again to get it on with her , only to have her deck him one .
with a couple of exceptions , the movie misses all of its own best moments .
the movie even looks cheesy , and not in a good way : i kept wondering if it had been transferred down from hi - def video or something , so grainy was the film stock in a good many scenes .
the whole thing has the air of being done on the cheap .
my definition of comedy is simply : did it make me laugh ?
the few times that i laughed in austin powers were completely offset by the time i spent cringing and wanting out .
the most damning thing i could say about the movie is that wayne and garth would most likely have shoved it into mike tyson 's shorts and sent it sailing .",0,"['the movie misses all of its own best moments', ""it 's desperate rather than clever"", 'looks cheesy , and not in a good way', 'inept slapstick , toilet humor', 'the bulk of the movie is taken up with dumb jokes', 'amazingly bereft of ideas', 'godawful "" comedy "" that \'s amazingly shabby and cut - rate , and rather bereft of laughs', 'cringing and wanting out', 'padding it out with toilet jokes', 'would have also sucked rocks through bamboo shoots', 'a rather bloodless and unfunny tribute']"
"i want to be involved in show business one day .
and i refuse to do any sequels to any movie i may make because i believe they only get worse .
this movie proves it for me .
i was a little worried about the last batman film ,
as i thought joel schumaccer , taking over from tim burton , would screw it up .
i also assumed val kilmer would screw up as bruce wayne .
they did n't .
kilmer did a good job , and the cast was left to carry the movie , which they did ( even jim carrey as the riddler and i ca n't stand jim carrey ) , because schumaccer messed up the direction with his glitzy gotham and his awkward camera angles .
this film is different .
the cast is still impressive , but here ,
not only does schumaccer mess up with the direction
( he 's one of those directors who 's good with actors , terrible with camera angles ) , but writer akiva goldsmith does n't really give an impressive cast anything to do .
the cast is impressive : clooney is a surprisingly good wayne / batman , o'donnell is a crafty robin as usual , they could 've casted somebody better as batgirl ( my friend likes neve campbell ) , but silverstone is not bad , and thurman is a good poison ivy .
the major problem is schwarzenegger , who is a terrible freeze .
his accent is so heavy , you ca n't understand what he says , and the trouble with action stars like him is they can not act
,
and they know it , but they figure that if they flex their muscles , say a limited amount of stuff , and kill a bunch of guys , then they figure nobody'll notice .
that 's the trouble with me ,
* i * notice .
schwarzenegger does not deserve billing over clooney , or as much money as he got for this , but hollywood thinks he does .
patrick stewart was the person i 'd heard that was considered to play freeze , and he would 've been so much better .
or sean connery , but not arnold
"" i 'm not an actor , but i play one in real life "" schwarzenegger .
i realize that you must be a star to play a major role in a batman film , but it would 've been nice if they 'd casted a star that had talent for the role .
akiva goldsmith 's screenplay avoids some stuff that happens in a normal batman film .
in a regular batman film , they 'd concentrate on the relationship with the girlfriend a little more , but elle macpherson 's julie madison is so limited here that we never get a real sense of who she is .
there is talk of a fifth batman movie .
my interest to see it is low , but i hope it 's better than this .
if you do n't want to waste your time , rent any of the other batman movies from blockbuster .

"an astonishingly difficult movie to watch , the last temptation of christ may be scorsese 's most important film , and yet his most impossibly abstract as well .
scorsese presents the life of jesus christ
, through nikos kazantzakis ' novel , which details the life of christ from approximately 20 until the day of crucifixtion .
jesus of nazareth ( dafoe ) is a carpenter , who opens the film making crosses , so that he can escape the fate he is subjected to , his destiny on earth .
yet , he soon learns his evil ways for aiding in the deaths of others , and subjects himself to a desert in exile , in hopes that he can reach god .
before leaving , he asks for forgiveness from mary magdelene ( barbara hershey ) , a prostitute who is also a childhood friend of jesus .
after going to the desert , christ learns his true purpose in life , and what he must do .
aided by judas ( keitel ) , he sets off on teaching the world his message .
along the way , he meets john the baptist , the rest of the prophets , and tries to teach the world his message .
christ is also confronted by internal demons and self - doubt , as he tries to find his true purpose throughout the entire film .
during the story , judas is the closese ally of jesus : his betrayal , argues the film , was not out of hate , but out of love , in order to allow christ to die .
he is eventually captured , and crucified as per the bibile .
however , as he is about to die on the cross , he is saved by a girl , who brings him to his marriage with mary magdelene .
the girl is a guardian angel who is from god , and who has saved him from his death .
jesus goes on to live a life as a man , as a carpenter , and does not die on the cross .
on his deathbed , in the final moments of his life , he is visited by the prophets , and by judas , who denounces his master for "" not keeping his end of the bargain .
""
judas reveals the angel to truly be the devil , and the life jesus had lived to be the ultimate selfish act .
jesus escapes from his deathbed , and asks his father for forgiveness , for succumbing to his last temptation .
visually and aurally , the film is absolutely breathtaking .
no other director has even come close to realizing jerusalem during the time of christ 's life to the screen .
peter gabriel contributes a score than is simply astonishing , with pulsing rhythms that capture the viewer .
the performances are simply exquisite , with dafoe leading the way with a mesmerizing turn as jesus .
keitel , although his accent is a problem , is passionately brilliant , fighting through language to bring the character to life .
the visuals are also amazing .
scorsese frames his movie in a harsh tone , leaving the impression that jesus truly is a man who is having human frailties .
the film , though , has many trouble spots .
paul schrader 's script is one .
schrader uses modern - day new york english to tell the story , along with new york words , new york mannerisms , and new york slang speech .
the film also does not focus on the godly aspects of christ .
there is no underlying message behind the man 's words .
the film fails to capture the glory and splendor of christ .
had it faithfully explored that aspect , than the dichotomy of jesus ' soul , his frailties and doubt mixed with his unmistakable glory , would have been simply spectacular .
the message of christ is confused between love and violence , and the film merely tells us jesus is great , instead of showing us his greatness .
the film is also overlong .
it just drags in the middle , with nothing truly happening .
christ is a confused figure , in the sense that the audience does n't know who he really is .
schrader forgets to give jesus a message , to show that he truly is the messiah , to give him the divinity .
without that , he is a rambling prophet , who the audience themselves do not believe .
there are several moments of accidental hilarity , and most of them occur when jesus is attempting to preach .
there are moments of brief awe and power , followed by moments of confused hilarity .
that said , the controversial temptation sequence is something to behold .
it is a step in an unexpected direction , one that leaves the audience puzzled , until the arrival of the disciples .
it is a simply breathtaking scene , with jesus about to die as a mortal .
it is truly one of scorsese 's finest moments .
it is unfortunate that scorsese could n't make a film about christ as powerful as that one scene .",1,"[""truly one of scorsese 's finest moments"", 'visually and aurally , the film is absolutely breathtaking', 'passionately brilliant', ""may be scorsese 's most important film"", 'no other director has even come close', 'the visuals are also amazing', 'as powerful as that one scene', 'a simply breathtaking scene', 'contributes a score than is simply astonishing , with pulsing rhythms that capture the viewer . the performances are simply exquisite , with dafoe leading the way with a mesmerizing turn']"
"forget get carter .
instead . . . get me a cup of coffee .
what the hell has happened to all good american action movies ?
did i unknowingly miss a meeting somewhere ?
when did all of the bad - ass , kicking butt and taking names , gun - toting , crazed , vengeful characters of the 1980 's -- from such films as commando , cobra , predator , raw deal , first blood -- suddenly turn into innocent , compassionate , sensitive , teary - eyed knuckleheads .
the only place to turn these days for an honest action film is towards the east -- and i do n't mean new york city .
get carter -- the latest masterpiece from uber - thespian sylvester stallone -- is a prime example of large and in charge 80 's action stars trying to fit back into action roles they have long since outgrown .
stallone seems like that one uncle you have who tries to be cool with his members only jacket and izod polo shirt with the collar popped up .
a few years ago , stallone made a movie that gave him the opportunity to gracefully exit the roles that typecast him as an action monkey .
that role was sheriff freddy heflin in copland -- a strange film about redemption within a broken soul .
stallone actually gave an amazing performance and it seemed he had shaken off the past .
too bad get carter returns stallone to action , but with the shiny paint rusted off on the edges .
get carter is a simple story .
stallone plays frank carter , a vegas bruiser for a loan shark ( played with amazing gusto by the uncredited voice of actor tom sizemore ) .
when frank 's brother gets himself killed in a drunk driving accident , frank , feeling all guilty and mushy inside , thinks foul play is involved and travels to seattle to set right all the wrongs with the patented "" carter 's way "" .
he talks tough with his brother 's wife , lends a helping had to his brother 's daughter doreen ( rachel leigh cook ) , and walks around seattle in the pouring rain dressed like a lost member of the rat pack with a really bad goatee .
carter finds out that his brother was involved in some bad stuff with a slimy porn king played by ultra - cool , mcqueen - esque mickey rourke , a multi - millionaire computer geek ( alan cumming ) , and a strange foreign guy ( michael caine ) who speaks in riddles and talks tough .
carter stalks all of them while trying to figure out who did in his brother and how to extract proper revenge on the responsible parties .
what a minute !
this sounds just like another film i saw last year , the limey .
better not tell terence stamp about stallone ripping him off .
actually , get carter is a remake of the 1971 british production of the same name , starring caine in the title role ( and what with his cameo here , the cleverness is astonishing ) .
while stallone still carries his own weight here ,
the movie lacks what the original did as well : purpose
.
throughout the film , stallone looks like an old guy trying to act tough , while nobody is taking him seriously .
his one - liners fall flat , and he seems tired and uncertain of all the actions , mental and physical , required of his character .
there is even a strange homoeroticism between rourke and stallone that lends a bizarre tone to their numerous conversations -- in both fists and words .
the biggest surprise in get carter is that the best job done in the film is by the versatile mickey rourke .
an amazing method actor in the eighties who fell into drugs , spousal abuse , a boxing career , and an intolerable attitude towards not getting his way , rourke still brings a dangerous sense of purpose to his porn king character .
he may not win any oscars , but he still ranks highly in my book .
get carter has great directing , strong acting by rourke and caine , and energetic car chases that would make william friedkin proud .
the only thing it lacks - as with most hollywood productions -- is a good script and proper casting .
never mind that it should never have been made at all .",0,"['the movie lacks what the original did as well : purpose', 'the shiny paint rusted off on the edges', 'the only thing it lacks - as with most hollywood productions -- is a good script and proper casting . never mind that it should never have been made at all', 'looks like an old guy trying to act tough , while nobody is taking him seriously . his one - liners fall flat , and he seems tired and uncertain', 'too bad', 'what the hell has happened to all good american action movies ?']"
"david lynch 's "" blue velvet "" begins and ends with colorful , bright shots of flowers and happy americans mowing their lawns in a seemingly perfect american town .
however , what lies inside this nominally safe atmosphere is a "" strange world "" of drug dealers , sadists , and murderers .
the opening and closing shots are a wonderful contrast to the rest of the gloomy , disturbing film .
they show not to make assumptions from first glance and that oddness is common in all places under all circumstances .
odd would be a perfect adjective to describe this film , its characters , its direction , and its story .
thankfully , the obscurity that "" blue velvet "" relies on is enough to make this film enjoyable . since its elements are so originally weird , you never know what will happen next .
this is the main goal of a movie ; to be spontaneous and surprising .
"" blue velvet "" miracuously succeeds at this even though it contains mediocre acting .
lynch creates such a hypnotic world that it is hard to resist his style of story telling .
the film starts off with the discovery of a severed ear by a college boy ( kyle maclachlan ) .
from this point maclachlan finds himself involved with a lounge singer ( isabella rossellinia ) who has lost her son and husband to a kidnapping .
the plot is much more detailed than the aforementioned and this is what makes david lynch 's story telling so amazing .
maclachlan becomes involved in a forbidden relationship , in another relationship that could have been taken straight out of a high school flick , and he is put into the shoes of a drug dealer who has some wild adventures with some wild friends .
through these multiple stories , maclachlan lives multiple lives and as we follow maclachlan , we are introduced to a variety of interesting subplots .
lynch masterfully builds these subplots but he does not piece them all together in the very end and make a convenient crowd pleasing conclusion .
instead he leaves some ambiguity and forces those curious enough to get the real meaning to watch the film several several times .
lynch has been known to do this with a number of his films meaning he may be too esoteric for some hoping to get a hollywood ending where the good guy gets the girl and everything turns out fine .
however , for fans of odd difficult indies , "" blue velvet "" could be just what they are looking for .
it is very hard to discuss "" blue velvet "" without discussing the performance of dennis hopper 's sadistic frank .
most of the other actors in the film were not very memorable .
kyle maclachlan lacked one important aspect for his role , a personality .
laura dern was consistently annoying .
but dennis hopper stole every scene he was in .
his evil character was just plain old frightening in his mannerisms from his obsession to velvet to his incessant breathing from a gas mask .
frank is a character that comes along once in a blue moon .
many producers know this and have inevitably begun to typecast hopper as the bad guy .
just like his villain in "" speed "" , hopper is over the edge with cursing and screaming every chance he has to speak .
this harshness is exactly what frank is , so weird and twisted that it is hard not to look at him , even if he theatens you to look away .
""
blue velvet "" has characters and stories you will never see in a movie again .
for this sole reason it is recommended .
but also see it to admire lynch 's obsession to avoid the norm .
even if this film is a little too weird for you ,
it 's hard not to congratulate a guy for trying something new and sticking to it .",1,"['miracuously succeeds', ""it 's hard not to congratulate a guy for trying something new and sticking to it"", 'masterfully builds these subplots', 'enjoyable', 'it is recommended']"

i suppose i 'm not extremely surprised that "" virus "" comes to us from a deciple of james cameron ( john bruno ) , and if i strain real hard , i could even say that it 's an obvious given , particuarly looking from the standpoint of mr .
cameron 's early works .
in fact , "" virus "" is yet another in the long line of action / horror / paranoia thrillers from the "" aliens "" vein : a group of people are dropped into a mysterious situation only to find a mortally - threatening entity is out to get them , a textbook example hailing all the way back to the early talkies , and maybe even to the first pictures , albeit redeveloped by cameron in his 1986 blockbuster that earned him esteem and bigger budgets to come in his future .
no such thing will happen to bruno , whom i believe worked in some capacity on that quasi - landmark feature ; while bruno may have studied under cameron 's wing for years and years , i 'm beginning to wonder at what capacity , and what exactly did he learn from him .
in fact , "" virus "" should at least be mediocre ;
the fact that bruno could have worked under a man like cameron - a director who , if anything , just knows how to make a movie - and then make a film like "" virus "" is just another detraction fairly aimed at this z - grade schlockfest of a film , albeit a z - grade schlockfest with a respectable budget .
the film seems to not only borrow it 's plot from last year 's similarly - fated "" deep rising , "" but also from a clunkish b - movie from the ' 80s called "" leviathan , "" an underwater thriller starring peter weller , richard crenna , hector elizando , and daniel stern about a group of miners who stumble upon an alien lifeform that was part "" alien , "" part john carpenter 's twisted remake of "" the thing .
"" "" virus , "" again , has a similar , uh , selling point : a group of sailors on a boat stumble upon a russian cruiser that is dead in the water .
they get on .
they break up into pairs and investigate .
and they find an alien lifeform on board that comes in the form of energy , has taken over all the machines on board , have meshed the machines with parts from corpses , and have deemed humankind their enemy because of a misquote in the dictionary ( ha ha ) .
not that any of this is for a second scary or the least bit involving ; not only does this film start off with a chintzy bond - ian opening ( the destruction of the cruiser via a satellite transmission from mir ) , destroying any of the suspense in what could happen , but it also fails to bring us any interesting chracters . of its motley crew , it only choses as its potentially eccentric cast of characters a lead woman skipper , a masculine potential - romantic - interest , a drunken captain , a black technician , a tatooed aborigine , a manic russian survivor , and a couple other candidates for alien food , none whom are the least bit interesting or more dimensional than a thin , plain piece of writing paper .
and it 's not the traditional argument for films like these , where you may in fact want them all to be eaten ( even "" aliens "" played with the karma of the arrogant soldiers , but this was more of a plus - side for the film as a whole than the opposite ) ; instead , as another cliche goes , you just do n't give a damn .
i almost do n't even have to say that the acting from everyone ranges from sub - par to horrific , the former being jamie lee curtis in the lead showing off what a strong female lead she is ( and she is , just not really here ) and the latter being - and it pains me to say this as he 's a particular favorite of mine - donald sutherland , who plays the captain so poorly and without a second of credibility that this will go down as the performance - of - which - he - should - be - ashamed
.
like anthony hopkins for "" legends of the fall "" ( the line "" scrooooooo 'em "" has been thus embroidered upon my membrance ) .
or peter o'toole in "" caligula .
"" great actor , horrific performance .
it happens every now and then , and it only helps sutherland 's career that
no one , except for an elite few , even bothered to see this film .
though it has sat on the shelves of universal studios for about two years , waiting until it can be released and make as much money as it possibly can ( read : early january , when everyone 's still trying to catch up on the potential oscar - nominees ) , it does show that universal shelled out a pretty penny to make this film : it 's laden with complex machinery , boasts respectable production design , and it may even feature believable special effects . . .
if , of course , i , or anyone else , could see them .
"" virus "" mostly takes place on a large , abandoned cruiser , and mostly at night until the dawn , and mostly without the use of lights , not so much for the productivity of the alien creatures in their pursuit of their human prey , but more so because , as the hollywood cliche seems to go , "" if it 's dark enough , then the special effects will be more believable .
""
and if you do n't believe me , go back and rent "" godzilla , "" and tell me if there 's even one shot where we see godzilla
either a ) in his entirety in one wide shot , or b ) n the light so that we can at least see him
( well , you do n't really have to sit through it again ; just take my word for it ) .
but all of this does n't matter since "" virus "" is basically just one loud , cluttered mess of a movie .
the action scenes are muddled and as difficult to follow as any action movie i 've ever seen ( my , um , favorite part was the scene where a trio of them end up somehow on the outside of the ship , during a five minute bouillabaisse of tidal waves , rain , and any other ocean - extremeties the film can cook up , then end up back in the ship when one of them is revealed to have apparently drowned - well , i must say , thanks for telling me afterwards because i sure could n't figure it out when i saw it ) .
imagine the first attack of the aliens in "" aliens , "" shot from the pov of the soldiers and then the authorities in the battle car if it was all hard to follow and done without any dramatic intensity , and that 's basically the whole of "" virus "" :
one horribly - directed action scene after the other , capping it off with a proposterous gadget
that saves the day and at least a couple of the original cast members .
and my god , it 's a long damn sit .
with no interesting characters , no dramatic urgency , no tension , not one good moment of action , and no mesmerizing visuals , it 's a wonder that it even got made .
we already know that big movie studios ' mentality is shallow at best , and movies like "" out of sight "" and "" saving private ryan "" give you more faith in them , but movies like "" virus "" manage to drain a little more out of the pool .
i almost wish that instead of making this movie , john bruno had gone cinema verite and captured the meetings with universal heads when they gave this film a green light .
they read the script , they knew they were entrusting millions upon millions of dollars into a director who might have very well been a cameron hack ( and he is ) , and they still went ahead with the project , only to have bruno and company shit back in their face .
even though i hold universal in contempt for making this horrible movie , i 'd say even more contempt should be aimed at mr .

"cinema has been around for about a hundred years now .
?
it 's not my job to recap this century every time i talk about a new film , but i 'd like to think that i 'm beginning to understand the art more as i watch more films from before my time .
recently , i 've seen the films of hitchcock , capra , fellini , godard , kurosawa , chaplin , lang , and many others . ?
those men were talented artists , and their films reflect their genius . ?
they are likely to be remembered for .
. .
well , quite a while .
?
i like this film , too .
?
yes , it 's a disaster - slash - action movie .
?
true , its budget is a lot more money than i 'll ever see in my lifetime . ?
and there 's not a doubt in my mind that the only reason it was conceived was to make a lot of money .
?
in fact , i bet the producers of armageddon would have worked towards a lousy film , had they thought it would 've been more profitable .
i certainly do n't care what their intentions were , because michael bay ( the rock ) is such a skilled director that i doubt he 'd ever make a film that is difficult to sit through .
of course , skillful direction does n't complete the package , but the rest of armageddon manages to keep everything together .
the story is well - thought out ( and perfectly paced to provide for an abundance of action sequences that never feel out of place ) ,
the acting is terrific , the script is sharp , and -- get this -- there are characters .
yes , you read that right .
armageddon actually has characters you can care about ! if you do n't like this film , then you have a problem with the genre itself : armageddon is as good as a film like this
can be .
if you 've seen deep impact , then you know the basic framework for the story .
it turns out that an asteroid the size of texas is going to strike the earth eighteen days from the start of the film .
so , it 's up to the u
. s .
government to stop it .
( why the u . s .
is always exclusively saddled with these problems is never fully investigated . )
their plan -- to send a group of experienced oil drillers up to the asteroid , drill down several hundred feet , and detonate a nuclear warhead within .
the head driller is harry stamper ( bruce willis ) .
his group of men is a colorful bunch , including a .
j .
( ben affleck ) , chick ( will patton ) , and rockhound ( steve buscemi ) .
there 's also an interesting triangle formed between a .
j . , harry , and grace ( liv tyler ) , who is harry 's daughter .
a .
j .
and grace are , of course , romantically intertwined , and dad is n't too happy with the situation .
it 's absurd to wish for a complicated story in an event movie or a special effects movie or
whatever it is you 'd like to call armageddon .
it 's not about story -- it 's about viscera and action , and thrills - a - minute , and all that stuff .
it 's incidental , really , that the story is cohesive and even remotely believable , because most people will be too wrapped up in the explosions to give two seconds ' thought to what actually happens .
but bay is the one to congratulate in this case , for he has made a film
so entertaining and so visually sharp
that i doubt any director could have done it better .
i think most of the budget went to cameras alone , because bay films every action sequence from about thirty or forty different angles .
take the spectacular opening scene , for instance , in which a meteor shower obliterates new york .
a meteor flies out of the sky and crashes into a building , which sends fireballs erupting into the air and cars spinning like tops upon other cars .
the action itself might take five seconds in real life , but bay edits so quickly that we get the same scene in six different ways .
i like his quick - edit style , because it 's abrasive and exhausting to watch .
it 's also very loud , and obnoxiously noisy at times .
but it 's fun to be obnoxious sometimes .
the special effects in this film put every other 1998 blockbuster to shame .
deep impact , visually , has absolutely nothing on armageddon , and to offer a comparison between the quality of this film and godzilla is simply laughable .
special effects are very important in a film like this : if they 're not good , then the image is not convincing , and the film does n't work .
everything here looks bright and explosive
-- from the little meteors bursting through skyscrapers , all the way to the shots of the earth through the jutting rocks on the ominously approaching asteroid .
the effects that do n't look totally real are still a pleasure to behold , and i credit everyone involved for creating the first blockbuster
so nice - looking that it actually qualifies as art
.
of course , all of this would add up to little more than an above - average light show , if i did n't get the feeling that bay cares as much about his characters as he does about his action .
the film is two and a half hours long , and not all of that is spent submerged in numbing action .
much of the film is dedicated to developing the various characters ' subplots .
i wo n't suggest that these are complex characters , but their problems are real , and the emotions are n't put forth in a sentimental and overbearing way .
in fact , there are three or four scenes here that had me pretty choked up , and that 's a lot more than i can say about deep impact , which was banking on the feel - good parts of its story .
bruce willis is terrific , and i 'm glad to see him bigger than life again ( recent turns in films like mercury rising have been very disappointing ) .
tyler and affleck are great together , and make a convincing couple -- all of the scenes between them work on a comfortable level .
patton , who is a magnificent actor , thankfully is not wasted here , and the minor subplot revolving around his ex - wife and son is very moving
.
the comic relief from buscemi and peter stormare ( who plays a crazy russian astronaut ) is nifty , and keeps the film lively and funny
.
i was n't challenged to think real hard while watching armageddon , and i do n't mind too much .
but the film does n't insult my intelligence -- it 's pitched perfectly to entertain , which is what all it really wants to do .
it 's not mindless and escapist , but well - crafted cinema .
it might have been created for the wrong reasons , but men like michael bay have my respect for showing me that they are interested in making something good , in spite of the producers and the budget .
i 'm not saying that films like this are risky moves .
what i am saying is that armageddon is a big , loud , expensive motion picture that reminds me that art often comes in the strangest of forms .",1,"['perfectly paced', 'a pleasure to behold', 'a magnificent actor , thankfully is not wasted here', 'to offer a comparison between the quality of this film and godzilla is simply laughable', 'terrific', 'the special effects in this film put every other 1998 blockbuster to shame', 'never feel out of place', 'everything here looks bright and explosive', 'manages to keep everything together', 'nifty', 'very moving', 'the acting is terrific , the script is sharp', 'lively and funny', ""it 's not mindless and escapist , but well - crafted cinema"", 'so entertaining and so visually sharp', 'well - thought out', 'are great together , and make a convincing couple', 'so nice - looking that it actually qualifies as art', 'pitched perfectly to entertain']"
"whenever writer / director robert altman works in a specific genre , he has the tendency to rewrite it on his own terms .
he made the west dirty in "" mccabe and mrs .
miller "" ( 1971 ) , he parodied hard - boiled detective stories in "" the long goodbye "" ( 1973 ) , and he transformed a cartoon into flesh and blood with "" popeye "" ( 1980 ) .
the same holds true for his most recent film , "" the gingerbread man , "" which reinvents a genre that has developed at an exponential rate over the last five years : the john grisham movie .
by the time "" the gingerbread man "" was completed , there was very little evidence that it was ever based on a story by grisham .
there 's no idealist young lawyer ala tom cruise , matthew mcconaughey , chris o'donnell or matt damon , and it does n't feature a great showdown in a courtroom .
instead of being a grand ode to the powers of the legal profession , "" the gingerbread man "" is a rain - soaked , southern gothic noir thriller with wildly eccentric characters , a twisting plot line , black humor , a somewhat bleak ending , and even altman 's trademark full - frontal female nudity .
the central character of the film is rick magruder , who is unlike any of grisham 's other lawyer heroes .
he is older , experienced , and rich ; he drives a cherry - red $ 80 , 000 mercedes that never gets dirty , even in the incessantly pouring rain of savannah , georgia , where the story unfolds .
rick is in the midst of an ugly divorce with his wife , leeanne ( famke janssen ) , and he rarely gets to see his two children , jeff ( jesse james ) and libby ( mae whitman ) .
a reason is never given for the divorce , but it is n't hard to surmise that rick 's womanizing had a large part in it .
whenever he 's late to pick up the kids on his visitation days , leeanne always assumes it 's because he 's been "" screwing around .
""
after an office party celebrating another of his court victories ( he has n't lost in eight years ) , rick becomes involved with mallory doss ( embeth davidtz ) , one of the catering waitresses .
he drives her home because her car has been stolen , and they end up in bed together .
rick finds out that mallory is being terrorized and stalked by her slightly psychotic father , dixon doss ( robert duvall ) , a grungy , stringy , bare - footed old man who leads a commune of other greasy old codgers .
it was actually dixon who stole her car that night , and when rick asks why , mallory replies that he always does "" weird "" stuff like that .
as another character puts it , dixon is "" a few beers short of six - pack .
"" rick ends up convincing mallory to have dixon brought to court and tried for competency .
he succeeds with information dug up by clyde pell , a private investigator friend ( robert downey jr . ) , and testimony from mallory 's begrudging ex - husband , pete randle ( tom berenger ) .
dixon is put in a mental hospital , but his commune buddies succeed in breaking him out .
from there , the story delves into kidnapping , murder , double - crossing , and even a hurricane that adds an ominous cloud of constant violence to the action .
altman 's cinematographer , changwei gu , gives the film a dark , soaked look .
if it is n't night - time , at least it 's raining .
gu shoots the interiors , which are almost all dark wood paneling , with a minimum of light .
a great deal of the action takes place in the leafy georgia backwoods , which altman uses to create an acute sense of dread and vulnerability .
in the city there is danger enough , but when rick has to venture into the woods , you can almost feel him leaving all hope of civilization behind as he literally enters another world .
altman has worked in just about every conceivable genre , from westerns to epic dramas to comedies .
but , no matter what the genre , he is always sure to give it the altman stamp , which usually consists of all kinds of idiosyncratic quirks and little details that are often missed without repeat viewings .
""
the gingerbread man "" is no different , although his style is much more restrained here .
however , without those little touches , the film could have easily slumped into a routine action / thriller .
a great deal of the credit for the film 's success can be given to the actors , especially branagh , who rarely works outside of period pieces and his own direction .
here , the british actor consistently maintains a serviceable southern drawl , while making an essentially contemptible character interesting and sympathetic .
rick is an extremely flawed man , but branaugh brings real humanity to his character . without it , the entire film would fall flat because so much of it is reliant on the audience feeling rick 's pain and frustration .
the supporting actors also put in fine performances , including embeth davidtz , who is probably best known for her heart - breaking role as the jewish maid in "" schindler 's list "" ( 1993 ) .
tom berenger provides some gruff comic relief , and robert duvall spends most of his on - screen time just looking weird .
it does n't seem like he does much because he has very little spoken dialogue , but watch him closely during the film 's one courtroom scene : his entire performance is in his eyes and his body language , and few actors could have pulled it off without being either silly or overbearing .
while "" the gingerbread man "" is n't in league with altman 's greatest works like "" nashville "" ( 1975 ) or "" the player "" ( 1992 ) , it is nonetheless a solid piece of genre filmmaking , which may prove a successful vehicle to restart his somewhat lagging career .
some critics love to stamp films like this as "" commercial , "" as if altman can only maintain artistic integrity if his films are aimed at a tiny audience and do n't make money .
altman has done something much better : he took what could have been a generic movie , and by investing artistry and effort , he made it into something more .",1,"['the supporting actors also put in fine performances', 'reinvents a genre', ""a great deal of the credit for the film 's success"", 'a solid piece of genre filmmaking']"
"i know there were times during this movie that i laughed pretty hard .
the problem is
, i ca n't remember them as i write this review .
that 's not a good sign .
in booty call , jamie foxx is bunz , a character whom i ca n't really describe , because i do n't know that much about him .
i only know that he likes to shoot dice on the sidewalk , and that he does n't like relationships ,
just "" booty calls "" at three in the morning ( no questions , no commitment ) .
bunz has a best friend named rushon ( tommy davidson ) , who seems to be bunz 's direct opposite : on the straight and narrow , and currently in a long - term commitment ( a whole seven weeks ,
wow ! ) .
rushon wants to finally sleep with his girlfriend , nikki ( tamala jones ) , but for a reason which is not totally explained , it 's going to happen after a double date with bunz and nikki 's friend lysterine ( vivica a . fox ) , who have never met .
to make a long story short , the two couples pair off and spend the rest of the evening having their attempts to do the deed spoiled by nikki 's obsession with safe sex .
first she wants condoms , so bunz and rushon go out and get them .
oh , no , they have to be latex , not lambskin .
back to the store .
now they 've got to get dental dams , or there 'll be no foreplay .
why are both couples stopped each time
nikki makes a demand ?
nikki phones lysterine , who lives across the hall , and tells her she 'd better be making these demands , too .
talk about coitus interruptus .
booty call is a film that does not know whether it wants to be a regular comedy or one of those over - the - top comedies .
the difference between the two is that in the latter , things constantly happen which are so far removed from reality .
in this category , for example , you have ace ventura :
private eye on the mild side , and airplane !
at the extreme .
there are times during booty call where the film steps out of its shell and tries for this status , but then too often quickly retreats to the safety of convention .
it is disappointing , and even worse , distracting .
there are also instances where the screenplay by takashi bufford and bootsie parker ( are those real names ? ) does not live up to its potential , as jokes are left unexploited or even ruined by bad writing
.
for instance , there is a scene where our main characters are in a chinese restaurant .
bunz goes up to an asian gangster and speaks to him in fluent cantonese , much to everyone 's surprise .
however , when asked how he learned the language , he goes into this explanation of how he started picking up words from late - night kung - fu films , and soon gained mastery .
this negated the ludicrousness of the entire scene .
if , on the other hand , when asked how he learned to speak chinese , bunz simply replied with , "" kung - fu movies , "" and then moved on , the joke would have been much more effective .
this is because it would have been totally unbelievable , but funny because we know it is unbelievable .
by explaining the point and trying to make the ridiculous plausible , the film is not giving its viewers enough credit .
the inconsistency and uncertain believability unfortunately also raise other questions .
why are two such disparate people like bunz and rushon best friends ?
why do rushon and nikki fix up bunz and lysterine ?
if nikki is so obsessed with safe sex , why does n't she have some condoms at her own apartment ?
these questions are not answered by the screenplay , but are overlooked for the sole reason of moving the plot forward .
a very noticeable quality of booty call is the prevalence of unnecessary foul language .
some movies use a lot of swear words , but use them under very justifiable circumstances , as when they are employed consistent with a character 's pattern of speech .
other films , such as the recent jackie brown , use them in ways that almost parody themselves .
booty call just sticks them in to get laughs , and it does n't work .
they stick out like sore thumbs because there is almost no reason to use them .
half of the scenes seem to occur for no reason .
the chinese restaurant , a holdup at a convenience store , and a trip to the hospital seem to have nothing to do with the story , and are in there for filler .
this is surprising , considering that the film is less than eighty minutes long .
it 's too bad that the core of the film is n't much better , since it is comprised of sometimes funny , but forgettable dialog .
i refer you to the first paragraph of this review .",0,"[""just sticks them in to get laughs , and it does n't work . they stick out like sore thumbs because there is almost no reason to use them"", 'the prevalence of unnecessary foul language', 'the problem is', 'it is disappointing , and even worse , distracting', 'does not live up to its potential , as jokes are left unexploited or even ruined by bad writing', 'forgettable dialog', 'the film is not giving its viewers enough credit . the inconsistency and uncertain believability unfortunately']"
"the only two really good things that i can say about tarzan and the lost city are as follows : jane march was very cute as jane , and the movie was thankfully under 90 minutes in length .
if you have n't already figured it out , i did n't like this movie very much .
the plot was boring and contrived to the extreme .
tarzan ( casper van dien ) has now left the jungle and living in civilized society .
he is just days away from his impending marriage to jane , played by the aptly named jane march .
back in his former home of africa , a group of looters has found the key to locating a lost city .
( mind you
i never really figured out why they actually wanted to find this city . )
anyway , tarzan 's old jungle friend appears to him in a vision .
tarzan realizes that he must return to africa to help stop the bad guys from finding the lost city .
he leaves jane ( his first mistake , in my opinion ) and travels to africa .
of course , jane is hot on her ape man 's heals .
the two of them are reunited in africa where they do battle with the bad guys .
sound like a dumb explanation of the plot ?
it 's actually an improvement over the real thing .
the acting is just plain awful .
i 'm not quite sure what casper van dien was doing in this film , but it was n't acting .
jane march was n't a heck of a lot better , but at least she is easy on the eyes .
compounding the bad acting was the fact that in many places the dialogue had obviously been re - recorded , and i 've seen better dubbing in some old bruce lee movies . added to the sound problems was the cinematography .
this film was filled with beautiful african scenery .
but the panoramic scenery shots looked overexposed to me .
quite frankly , i think you could probably do a better job capturing the beauty of africa with a camcorder than this bunch did with professional film equipment .
then we have the special effects .
"" special effects in a tarzan movie ?
""
you are no doubt asking yourself ?
yes friends , the writers injected some very out of place supernatural elements into the story .
probably for the sake of using cgi , since it did nothing but hurt the story .
in most parts , they were n't bad , just nothing special .
but , they were more than a little on the hokey side .
except of course , when we got to the ridiculous climax of this movie .
the grand finale 's special effects went right into the toilet at that point .
it almost looked like they had run out of money .
these effects were of noticeably lower quality than those in the rest of the film and looked like something in an amateur video production .
i took one lesson away from watching tarzan and the lost city -- ape men and bones that morph into skeletal warriors do n't mix . stay far away from this version of tarzan .",0,"['they were more than a little on the hokey side', 'the panoramic scenery shots looked overexposed to me', 'just plain awful', 'the plot was boring and contrived to the extreme', ""i 've seen better dubbing in some old bruce lee movies"", ""was n't a heck of a lot better"", 'the ridiculous climax', 'added to the sound problems was the cinematography', 'were of noticeably lower quality', 'stay far away from this version', 'thankfully under 90 minutes in length', ""i did n't like this movie very much"", ""sound like a dumb explanation of the plot ? it 's actually an improvement over the real thing"", ""the grand finale 's special effects went right into the toilet""]"
"in double jeopardy , the stakes are high .
think of the plot as a rehash of sleeping with the enemy , and then rearrange the details and the gender of the stalker .
the finished product , although able to maintain the viewer 's attention , is
a predictable and unexciting thriller with an idiotic script .
` alex , i 'll take homicide for $ 400 . . . '
libby parsons ( ashley judd ) is a happily married mom leading a normal life .
one night , her husband nick ( bruce greenwood ) takes her out for a romantic escape on a sailboat .
libby awakens in the middle of the night to find she is covered in blood and nick has strangely disappeared .
she follows a trail of bloody footprints up to the deck , where she handles a fallen knife ( like any stupid character ) and is spotted by the coast guard , who are responding to a distress signal sent earlier in the evening .
nick is presumed dead , and although she pleads her innocence , libby is tried and convicted for the murder of her husband .
now , please do n't think i 'm spoiling any vital plot details , because the informative trailer has already spilled most of the beans . if you have n't seen this preview , do n't read any further .
but seriously , the inane screenplay by douglas
weisberg and douglas s
.
cook is so elementary that the average viewer will be two or three steps ahead of the characters .
during the most vital scenes in the movie , i was anticipating every twist or ` surprise ' that eventually popped up on the screen .
i imagine the writers presume their core audience for double jeopardy is a very naive group of individuals .
most , unfortunately , will be too distracted by the moronic plot to appreciate the few positive aspects of the production .
one is tommy lee jones , who plays travis lehman , a parole officer given the tedious task of watching over libby after she serves her sentence in prison .
jones is always wonderful as an authority figure , and he 's certainly familiar with this sort of role ( as he played so well in the fugitive and us marshals ) .
judd , as a likable heroin with gusto , also has a chance to flex her acting abilities .
while emotionally unconvincing , the actress is tremendously fun in her juvenile role , perking up the movie like an injection of anti - depressant .
the actors , and their relationship together , present the one - two punch that prevents double jeopardy from derailing itself entirely .
and now , back to the plot .
while behind bars , libby learns an interesting little bit of information : a person ca n't be convicted of the same crime twice .
this law , called ` double jeopardy ' , could be her motive for hunting down her husband .
.
. who may still be alive .
yes , you heard right .
the movie degenerates into a cross - country chase , where everything you expect to happen . . .
does .
the final scenes , which could have redeemed the film , are poorly handled by director bruce beresford - whose previous work centers highly around drama ( driving miss daisy , paradise road ) .
ironically , it is those elements - like the driving force of libby to reunite with her son - that do n't quite work here .
at least double jeopardy is paced well enough to satisfy diehard fans of the two stars .
unfortunately , jones lacks some of the edge that he had as sam gerard in the fugitive , and the real depth of his character is only skin deep .
but he and ashley judd are more than welcome considering the material , and both have some memorable comic moments .
judd , in particular , has a hilarious scene in which she wards off an oncoming male by explaining she has to check in with her ` parole officer ' .
hmmm .
. .
perhaps this would have made a good comedy .
it is disappointing , because there are the makings of a competent action film here .
it 's nicely shot and choreographed in downtown vancouver , and will entertain those who are n't turned off by the woeful story - line .

"i remember making a pact , right after ` patch adams ' , to not be easily be suckered by movies dripping with sentimentality .
but darn it , ` music of the heart ' is just layered with feel - good material and bright characterizations .
it 's hard to dislike a movie that uses such skill with it 's manipulation .
in addition , it 's also a terrific family film .
this is the true story of violin teacher
roberta guaspari , who fought the school board to keep the musical program active in a handful of inner city harlem schools .
it could also be described as ` mrs .
streep 's opus ' .
yes , meryl streep brings her dramatic clout to the demanding role of guaspari , and that brings both good news and bad .
out of the gate , possibly because of her distracting star power and the rushed writing , it is relatively difficult to identify with roberta 's character and grasp her academic point - of - view .
she is very strict with her students , but what insight does that create into the story ?
slowly but surely , we begin to recognize the intentions of the character , and show admiration for the thoughtfulness and human feeling that streep has once again applied .
one thoroughly interesting fact about ` music of the heart ' lies with the unlikely presence in the director 's chair : horror veteran wes craven .
after leaving an impression with the ` scream ' films and the original ` nightmare on elm street ' , craven has attempted a precarious cross - over to drama .
at first , his inexperience with the genre is fairly obvious , but as the film progresses craven finds a surprisingly comfortable niche with directing this material .
it does n't carry the heart - warming courage of ` mr .
holland 's opus ' , but ` music of the heart ' is casually assured and filled with little morsels of dramatic truth .
the tag team of streep and craven works better than you would anticipate .
yes , oscar could come calling once again for meryl streep , but it 's the solid ensemble cast that makes ` music of the heart ' work .
angela bassett displays her usual forceful stamina as janet williams , the principal at an inner city school who initially does n't hire roberta because of her lack of experience .
blue - eyed adian quinn is endearing , as always , playing a new love interest .
gloria estefan also delivers in the tiny role of a supportive second - grade teacher , and the three lead actresses together produce a flaming fireball of estrogenic force .
it 's like a schoolteacher 's version of ` thelma and louise ' , in a restrained but effective manner .
the movie tackles more issues than just guaspari 's teaching of violin .
there 's some powerful moments between roberta and her two sons , who must cope when their father leaves them for another woman .
in it 's dramatic build - up
, the movie manages to produce some authentic moments of feeling and warmth .
it 's a good movie for anyone to see , although missing out on the experience would not be a life - altering decision .
it 's commendable of wes craven to be attempting such a difficult cross - over , and also for achieving his intricate goal .
watching this heartfelt chick flick about morals and musical instruments , who may ask yourself : this is the guy who directed ` scream ' ?
of course , when the third installment of that series comes around in february 2000 ( with craven directing ) , you may find yourself wondering : this is the guy who directed ` music of the heart ' ?
mission accomplished , wes .
thankfully , there is no layer of artificial sentiment covering the film .
in it 's entirety , it 's a wholesome and agreeable movie for the whole family , despite the periodic flaws that surface every once in awhile .
the child actors are cute and perform up to par , even if some of their problems are clich ?
d and predictable in the extreme .
the mother who does n't want her son to be learning ` white man 's music ' , the unexpected casuality .

basically everything is there .
it does n't strike the perfect chord , but ` music of the heart ' is highly convincing .

"one of the 90s ' most unwelcome thriller trends returns from the grave : it 's the "" _ _ _ from hell "" movie !
starting in the early nineties , we were subjected to nearly every conceivable combination of relationships - from - hell !
there were boyfriends from hell , friendly neighborhood cops from hell , nannies from hell , and even secretaries from hell .
but hush has found an old standby that somehow was forgotten in the rush : the mother - in - law from hell ! ! ! ! !
the mother - in - law in question is martha , played by jessica lange .
she has been single - handedly running the family horse farm , kilronan .
her son , jackson ( johnathon schaech ) and his girlfriend , helen ( gwyneth paltrow ) , live in new york , and have no intention to move back down south to the rural kilronan .
but those intentions are about to change .
you see , martha lives by manipulation .
she has used it in years past to breed many championship horses .
now , she believes she can use it to breed herself a grandson .
though at first , helen finds martha charming , soon she is caught in the domineering martha 's web of deception .
it 's hard to understand why nobody ever wises up to martha ' schemes .
as written , most of the characters in the film must be very slow witted .
but then , the film even treats the audience like idiots .
it tries to get away with things ( like leaving a critical piece of evidence in a rather unlikely place ) without even batting an eye .
then again an audience which accepts characters as shallow as these is n't one that 's likely to question details .
jessica lange 's martha is the only semi - developed character in the film , and she applies her talents to redeem it as much as she can .

"it 's always a bad sign when the core audience of a film -- children -- are either walking out early or are half - asleep when the credits roll at the end of a film .
that about sums up the dreadful ugliness of 102 dalmatians , a cold pea soup of cute animals , stupid home alone antics , a boring puppy love subplot between dumb humans , and glenn close reprising her best joan crawford impression .
indeed , walt disney is rolling over in his grave again , cursing john hughes ' name for making the original live - action 101 dalmatians , one of the worst kiddie flicks of all time , and now its sequel .
the main culprit behind the hideousness of 102 dalmatians is its predecessor , 101 dalmatians .
the original made more than $ 100 million dollars at the box office , spawned a torrid collection of "" collectible "" items that ended up months later in the discount bins of wal - marts across the country , and generally made every kid on the planet want a damn dalmatian pup for christmas .
well , it 's been about four years since then , and dalmatian fever is coming back , and this time it 's digitally enhanced .
here 's the story .
cruella de vil ( glenn close ) is released from prison due to the "" cure "" of her puppy homicide urges by one dr .
pavlov .
( oh , how witty . )
she rejoins the world as a dog lover and is assigned to a probation officer , who oddly turns out to be her victim from the original film .
cruella then becomes ella -- dog lover -- until the plot twists , like a dog with his leash caught on the back of a moving truck , and she becomes the evil vixen again .
a kidnapping plot unfurls again as cruella decides she still needs her dalmatian coat , but she now needs 102 dalmatians instead of the commonly used 101 dalmatian formula .
at this point , i was envying those kids filing out of the theater .
how low have glenn close and gerard depardieu ( as the film 's villain ) sunk in the film business ?
it 's almost laughable in a sadistic way to watch close walk around in costumes that seem to be pulled from the wardrobe of flash gordon . and depardieu . . .
how can a french guy have a bad french accent ?
and never mind the toilet brush haircut .
the only minutely positive selling point i can even think to point out is the talking bird with a british accent ( courtesy of eric idle ) that thinks he 's a rottweiler .
now that 's funny .",0,"[""it 's almost laughable in a sadistic way"", ""it 's always a bad sign"", 'the main culprit behind the hideousness', 'the dreadful ugliness', 'cold pea soup of cute animals , stupid home alone antics , a boring puppy love subplot between dumb humans', '( oh , how witty . )', 'rolling over in his grave', 'walking out early or are half - asleep when the credits roll', 'i was envying those kids filing out of the theater']"
"i recall the trials and tribulations of my high school years .
it was a period that would mercilessly force me to exit boyhood and thrust me into the unwelcome arms of adulthood .
but of all the experiences that i collected throughout those tender years , i can honestly say that the toughest and the scariest thing that i had to cope with was my raging hormones and my crazed curiosity about girls and sex .
yes , more scarier than my seventh grade english teacher and even scarier than the bullies that constantly hounded me , trying to deal with my personal wonderment about sex was like trying to fight an invisible monster .
for all teenagers , it 's almost like a rite of passage .
and what we did was sometimes downright nasty , sometimes funny , and sometimes shocking .
and all of that is
terrifically and shamelessly brought to light in what might be the funniest movie this summer .
` american pie ' is a comedy about four sexually frustrated seniors that enter into a pact to lose their virginity by the end of the school year .
just how great are their hormones raging ?
one of them notes , after watching disney
's the little mermaid
, that ariel is soooo hot .
the four schoolmates are kevin , oz , finch and jim .
kevin is the only one with a steady girlfriend , but does n't want to have sex until the time is just right .
but what is the perfect time ?
there is just no way to know , and that frightens him .
oz is the big jock who decides that the way to score with the girls is to listen to them and to be more sensitive .
he joins up with a jazz choir and discovers that getting in touch with his feminine side has some tremendous advantages .
finch is the phobic hermit who does n't stand a chance with any girl .
so , he pays someone $ 200 to start spreading rumors about his prowess .
suddenly , girls are lining up to go out with him .
but among these friends , it is jim that is the most curious and the most fearful .
when he has a chance to romp with a pretty exchange student , his inexperience comes shining through .
he has much to learn , and will do anything to seek out this kind of knowledge .
this may include watching scrambled porn channels or experimenting with mom 's apple pie in a scene that is completely shocking , raunchy , yet unbelievably funny .
the one thing that i want to say about this film is that it well deserves its ` r ' rating .
there is stuff in here
that is completely gross in the same manner that ` there 's something about mary ' was gloriously ribald .
in fact , at first this film received a sinful nc-17 rating before a couple of more cuts finally brought it down to a teen - accessible rating .
but i guess after seeing the no - holds - barred coarseness of south park , this seems tame by comparison .
teens and anyone who can still remember their acne years are the ones that will laugh hardest .
but unlike many teen sex comedies , there is a genuine intelligence at work here .
these are four normal boys who have a natural curiosity about sex .
their plans of action are thoughtful and they think about the consequences .
they know what they want , yet temper it with responsibility .
but almost always , it 's impossible to know how to fight the invisible monster , and it 's these episodes that make ` american pie ' such a carnal delight to watch .",1,"['terrifically and shamelessly brought to light in what might be the funniest movie this summer', 'a scene that is completely shocking , raunchy , yet unbelievably funny', 'such a carnal delight to watch', 'there is a genuine intelligence at work here']"
""" ladybugs "" is a typical comedy that relies on three supposed guarantees : the pathetic team who beats the champs ; cross dressing ; and the presence of rodney dangerfield .
this picture does n't play like a comedy for children , so who is it aimed at ?
and why is it told like a 91-minute sit - com instead of a feature film ?
rodney dangerfield stars as chester lee , a total schmuck working at a huge corporation .
he obviously does n't have a lot of self esteem and thinks he has to kiss up to get ahead , which he does by volunteering to coach the company 's girls ' soccer team .
what a shock to learn chester and his assistant julie ( jackee ) know absolutely nothing about the game , and the players seem to know even less .
i did n't laugh , but for some reason it did n't annoy me that much .
chester 's fiancee bess ( graff ) thinks he got a promotion in addition to the coaching position , and of course she has a slacker for a son who is doing poorly in school and is kicked off the sports teams .
jonathon brandis is a nice surprise as matthew , who agrees to dress up as a girl named martha to help out chester ( probably because the girl he has a crush on plays on the team - what original story ideas ! ) .
what we get is just another retread of the "" underdog sports team "" mixed with some cross dressing .
unfortunately , the film is n't smart enough to play upon the drag aspect .
in fact , it downplays it so heavily it 's totally unbelievable .
could it be any more obvious martha
is a boy ?
he only wears a girl 's wig , without any makeup , and they do n't even give him falsies .
brandis does n't bother to mimic a girl 's voice either .
then there is a pointless scene where chester and matthew shop for a dress , but for what reason ?
martha is only seen on the soccer field , why would they buy a dress for her ?
just when we think the martha character is going to be useful , she disappears , and the story wanders aimlessly looking for a new plot to pick up on .
when bess discovers what 's really going on she breaks up with chester , and the relationship is forgotten about and the film focuses on the soccer team and the tension between chester and his boss .
this film could 've been less bad
had it been the cliche sports comedy , but it feels the need to go off on tangents that are completely unnecessary ( and bad at that )
.
there 's just too much of a sit - com feel here , especially during the so - called serious moments , and all the confusion between the characters .
i 've seen worse movies than "" ladybugs , "" but for some reason it contained some sort of bizarre charm , so even when it turns sour it does n't seem as bad as it is .
dangerfield finally gets his respect in the end , but at what a price .",0,"['completely unnecessary ( and bad at that )', 'the story wanders aimlessly', ""unfortunately , the film is n't smart enough"", ""i did n't laugh"", 'there is a pointless scene']"

the world on land -- it 's just too big for me .
"" starring tim roth , pruitt taylor vince , bill nunn , clarence williams iii . rated r .
the legend of 1900s is the year 's most absurd movie , a rambling , nonsensical piece of seafaring garbage that goes nowhere fast
.
it stars thespian extraordinaire tim roth , looking wistful as ever , as a guy named . . .
1900 .
you heard right .
his name is , in all actuality , 1900 .
he was born on an ocean liner on 1/1/1900 ( uh , hence the name ) , abandoned and adopted by danny , a ship crewman .
1900 spends most of his early years hiding in the bowels of the ship because of danny 's fear that he might be taken away from him because of "" visa matters .
""
well , when 1900 is about 9 or so , he starts wondering all around the ship .
one day , he discovers a grand piano .
he sits down and starts playing .
miraculously , what comes out is beautiful .
a group of onlookers gathers to watch this stunning prodigy make such amazing music at such a young age .
when one of the people who knows 1900 tells him that his playing the piano like that without permission is "" totally against regulations
"" 1900 replies "" f
* ck the regulations !
""
ho
ho ho .
1900 grows up never setting foot on dry land .
when he 's about 30ish and can play the piano like nobody 's business , onboard comes another musician .
his name is max ( pruitt taylor vince ) and he plays the trumpet .
after 1900 catches max barfing everywhere during a storm , he sits him down on the piano next to him , takes the piano 's braces off and plays while the piano flies all around the hall , taking them with it .
how the chair they 're sitting on and the piano do n't separate , i do n't know , but this apparently is n't the kind of thing we 're supposed to ask .
after that , 1900 and max become friends .
max is determined to get 1900 off the ship and discover what he is missing on land , but 1900 has no intention of doing so .
what 's more , he does n't even want his music to go anywhere without him : when a record company hears about his talents , they come on board to make a record of his music , but after finding out that -- gasp !
-- they 're going to make millions of copies , he breaks the record .
the conflict of the movie is that after max , unsuccessful in his endeavor to get 1900 off the ship , gets off himself , he stumbles upon a record of 1900 's music in a store .
the record should n't exist because a ) 1900 never stepped on dry land and b ) the one record that was made on the ship was broken .
ladies and gentlemen , it 's a mystery !
the story itself is ludicrous and uninteresting and so are its elements .
we 're supposed to be roused by a climactic . . .
piano duel ?
there is n't anything in this movie with the potential to compel .
1900 comes off as a whiny , brooding , extremely unlikable man : i ca n't recall a single word he said that was not some sort of depressing pseudo- meditation on life .
ditto for max , who does n't seem to have a life outside his friendship with 1900 .
tim roth plays 1900 with about as much panache as a fig leaf ; there 's no spirit , no gusto to the character .
he insists that he leads a happy life on the ship , but to us he is dead .
pruitt taylor vince is a little more palatable , at least providing a moment of comic relief here and there to liven things up a bit .
the highlight of the movie would have to be the eminently amusing clarence williams the iii as the arrogant , leering "" king of jazz "" who challenges 1900 to the aforementioned piano duel .
the legend of 1900 was made by giuseppe tornatore , whose 1988 cinema paradiso is considered a masterpiece by many .
this effort is utterly limp and lifeless .
at once ridiculous , boring , narrow - sighted and pointless , this is one movie that should be -- and will be -- quickly forgotten .",0,"[""there 's no spirit , no gusto"", 'ridiculous , boring , narrow - sighted and pointless', ""there is n't anything in this movie with the potential to compel"", 'quickly forgotten', 'a rambling , nonsensical piece of seafaring garbage that goes nowhere fast', 'utterly limp and lifeless', 'the story itself is ludicrous and uninteresting', 'a whiny , brooding , extremely unlikable']"
"the jekyll and hyde story told from his maid 's point of view is , in a word , "" dark "" .
you would n't expect something bright and cheery based on robert louis stevenson 's novel , but the film is surprisingly dreary and dismal .
jekyll / hyde ( john malkovich ) is terminally depressed and desperate .
mary reilly ( julia roberts ) is a victim of monstrous child abuse and the anti - woman sentiment of the times .
director stephen fears ' version of the london slums makes us marvel that anyone survived them .
the lighting level is exceedingly low throughout the movie : it almost appears to be filmed in black and white .
the direction and cinematography are brilliant and liquid
. scenes flow into the next scene like honey oozing off a strawberry .
( except there 's no red , of course . )
the look is so moody and melodramatic that you 'll be shocked when you leave the theater .
i saw it at a matinee and took quite a while to adjust to the sunny skies afterward .
often the jekyll and hyde archetypes are viewed as splitting a whole person into components of good and evil or perhaps cerebral and emotional parts .
here the doctor is intellectual and perhaps good , but certainly powerless .
his alter ego is forceful and totally without conscience .
two parts that make up a whole .
neither are capable of functioning without the other and once separated , disaster is inevitable .
the differences between the two characters would be more effective if it were accomplished by demeanor and attitude .
when we finally see the transformation , the special effects thrust the story into the realm of science fiction , not the psychological horror that the tale demands .
roberts and malkovich are skillful in their roles .
both are suitably melancholy , fitting in with the rest of the film .
the only flash of life and color comes from glenn close ( and her lips ) as the madam of a whorehouse where hyde lives , and surprisingly , jekyll apparently frequents .
life and color maybe , but this is not close 's best role .
she seems little more than a cardboard cutout character .
a beautiful film in its own dreary way .

"every year -- every year at the festival , i wait for that film to come along , that one that just pulls me out of my seat , sticks its face up next to my nose , and roars "" sur - prise ! "" into my bewildered visage .
it 's almost always a surprise .
it sure as niflheim was this time .
amazing grace and chuck is being advertised as a modern fairy tale , of a boy in montana who quits his little league team for a very unusual reason .
and , in the hands of anyone less careful than the creative staff of this film , it might very well be nothing more than a fairy tale , where we roll our eyes occasionally , smirk to ourselves , and maybe get a forced tear out of the eyes and a "" boy
, i wish that could happen "" sigh out of the lips upon exiting the theater and tossing the empty pepsi cup into the trash .
another e .
t .
another short circuit .
this film floored me , for the simple reason that while it has a fairy tale concept , the rest of the film takes itself seriously enough , and presents itself well enough , to make it more of an american folk tale , with characters who are both icons and real people at the same time .
america has always had its mythical heros , its paul bunyans and john waynes ; this film presents us with more general , but still universal , ideals : the honest , innocent children who have their own inner wisdom ; the athletes who seem to be amalgamations of courage , honor , and love for their respective sport ; the venerable elected official who leads with kindness and understanding , but has the grit to get things done when they need doin' ( does the latter sound familiar ? ) .
amazing grace and chuck is a showcase for these characters , but it never leaves you with the feeling that it 's artificial , that it stands behind glass , or that any sharp breeze -- or , more importantly , sharp thought -- will shatter the wax facade of the panorama .
this is a very sturdy scenario .
the principals are always given dialogue , and always give performances -- always ( it just blows me away ) -- which made them seem real , yet enforces their particular mythic role .
the writer / producer , david field , seems to literally take all the "" yeah , but in real life , this would have happen "" thoughts you get in your head , sticks them in the movie and uses them to bend the plot around to his original heading , in a stronger way then before ! astounding !
he uses obstacles to the plot to * enforce * it !
i am truly impressed ( indeed , envious ) with the skill in which he wrote the story and screenplay ; it 's so very unusual , especially in a hollywood film .
i do n't want to give too much away , but the basic premise is that chuck ( joshua zuehlke ) , the little league pitcher , decides to give up baseball because of nuclear weapons .
his decision begins an unlikely series of events that involve another athlete , a boston basketball player ( alex english ) , "" amazing "" grace smith , and , well , i 'm leaving it at that because i would n't spoil this film for you for the world .
let me just say this , though : i am not recommending this film because i think it has a great message or because of any political positions it might imply .
i do n't give a rat 's ass for the political point - of - view this film expresses , one way or another ; i 'm recommending you go see this film because , and only because , it 's an excellent story , told with excellence .
no , i do n't believe what happens in this film could happen in real life ; while i tend to believe the arms control policy of this country is stilted , i believe in careful negotiations , mutual verification , etc .
screw what i think .
the point is , this film is able to suspend my disbelief and tell a story that is one of the most finely crafted pieces of american dream i have ever seen on the movie screen .
this is the natural and more -- all the mythic qualities without the pretentiousness or the forced feeling of the conclusion , and a much better script to boot .
it carried me into the beliefs and ideals of my boyhood -- and , more importantly , without any bumps or jolts that would snap me out of the trance with some hint of self - consciousness .
special kudos to : both zuehlke ( a real - life little league pitcher who was picked for the part ) and english ( a forward for the denver nuggets ) for their seamless personification of their characters ; jamie lee curtis , who takes a surprisingly small role and makes it exceedingly memorable as amazing 's manager and friend ; william l . peterson ( in a * big * change from his role in to live and die in l . a . ) as a father who shows principles without having to stand up and wave a flag doing it ; and gregory peck , as the guy we wish ronald reagan really was ( and who some numbskulls still probably think he is",1,"['takes itself seriously enough , and presents itself well enough , to make it more of an american folk tale', 'seamless personification', 'a much better script', 'i am truly impressed ( indeed , envious ) with the skill', 'astounding !', 'a very sturdy scenario', 'one of the most finely crafted pieces of american dream i have ever seen']"
"porter stoddard ( warren beatty ) is a successful architect married to successful fabric designer ellie ( diane keaton ) for twenty - five years .
they and best friends mona ( goldie hawn ) and griffin ( garry shandling ) are about to face marital crises in a film most well known for its torturous path to the screen , "" town and country .
"" "" town and country "" has a pedigree befitting it 's title with an all star cast photographed by oscar nominated cinematographer william fraker and mouthing the words of screenwriter buck henry ( "" the graduate "" ) under the direction of peter chelsom ( "" funny bones "" ) .
after years of reports of budget overruns and reshoots and the racking up twelve different release dates , the media has been prepped for beatty 's next "" ishtar .
""
so , is it that bad ?
the answer is no .
but it 's not very good either .
the major problem with "" town and country "" is that it 's unstructured and random .
stoddard is immediately established as a philanderer , having just bedded a flaky cellist ( nastassja kinski ) .
next scene finds him and ellie celebrating their anniversary in paris with mona and griffin .
then mona spies griffin hustling a redhead into a motel and begins divorce proceedings ( buck henry cameos as both couples ' divorce lawyer ) .
ellie thinks she 's overeacting , but sends porter to support mona on a trip to check out her family 's mississippi manse .
the two childhood friends end up in bed together , making us wonder why they 'd never become a couple to begin with . back home , their second coupling is interrupted by ellie bursting in to tell mona
she thinks porter 's cheating on her .
porter goes off on a trip with griffin to sun valley , idaho to have more comic misadventures with wacky women as griffin attempts to tell him that he 's gay .
the four friends , along with every woman porter 's dallied with , all end up back in new york city somewhat happily ever after .
although the film begins promisingly , resembling a woody allen take on new york city wasps , too many strands drift off into nowhere .
the stoddard household is huge , containing two adult children ( josh hartnett , "" the virgin suicides "" and tricia vessey , "" kiss the girls "" ) , their colorful bedmates and a maid who 's just imported her shirtless boyfriend from the rainforest back home .
after an amusing early scene that has porter overhearing three bouts of lovemaking while in search of a nocturnal snack , the six supporting players are dropped except for an out - of - nowhere appearance by the formerly forgotten son .
porter 's romantic misadventures with women ( other than mona ) are equally mishandled .
once the marital discord begins , the film seems as if it was editted with a machete , stopping and starting , never regaining its rhythm .
while beatty gets off a few tart observations , his character is mostly passive and bemused .
maybe we 're supposed to feel sympathy for an adulterer who does n't initiate his own sex romps ?
keaton 's ellie has a trusting nature that 's a result of her own self involvement resulting in an unlikeable character .
hawn smartly recycles her mature sex kitten wives of "" the out of towners "" and "" the first wives ' club "" while shandling 's relegated to true second banana status .
kinski is bland and unmotivated .
andie macdowell takes a weirdly unappealing role and does what she can with the screenplay 's most bizarre subplot , which finds charlton heston as her rifle toting , billionaire daddy and marian seldes as her alcoholic , wheelchair - bound , foul - mouthed mother .
heston and seldes are fun , as is jenna elfman as a sun valley bait and tackle salesgirl who brings porter and griffin to a halloween party .
oscar nominatored cinematographer william fraker gives the film a nice look , but director chelsom shows none of the quirkily and blackly humorous depth
he brought to films like "" hear my song "" and "" funny bones .
""
the script is this film 's weakest link - it 's telling that most of the ( few ) laughs come from old - fashioned physical slapstick and the sight of beatty in a bear suit .

"mulholland drive did very well at the cannes film festival .
as you can see from the rating it did not do very well from me at the toronto international film festival .
it may not be clear to the viewer why i am so negative on this film for most of the running time
.
in fact it is an interesting mystery story told on the backdrop of the hollywood film industry .
toward the end of the film i think everything that has been built falls apart .
the film was to be a pilot for a tv series but writer and director david lynch did not sell his tv pilot
and i think he decided that he wanted to do something else with it .
something else is what he did .
the film opens with a woman ( played by laura harring ) about to be killed in a car when a car crash saves her life .
she crawls away from the accident with a concussion and finds herself a bungalow with an unlocked door to sleep .
meanwhile young vivacious betty ( naomi watts ) arrives in hollywood from canada .
she wants to build a career as an actress .
betty is a little surprised to find a woman sleeping in the borrowed bungalow .
she does not know who the woman is .
she is even more surprised when the woman awakes and does not herself know who she is .
they fix on a name rita for her , but are not sure if this right or not .
meanwhile local director adam kesher ( justin theroux ) has problems of his own .
he is trying to cast one actress for his new film and is getting pressure from the producers and from crime figures to cast someone else , cammie rhodes ( melissa george ) .
these two threads are joined by a third one in which there is a strange and comic murder that goes terribly wrong .
there is also a strange character called the cowboy ( monty montgomery ) adding to the confusion .
in what was probably intended for the television pilot the film opens with a great vibrancy showing dancing 60s style under the credits .
a lot of mulholland drive starts out fun .
lynch wants you to know he could make an enjoyable stylish film .
he just chooses not to .
as with any david lynch film there is strange material added for little reason .
there are no earthworms , but there are some decidedly strange david lynch touches .
the film is a little long for the subject matter .
toward the end it gets into some heavier violence and sex scenes , clearly not intended for the tv pilot .
unfortunately some of the most important comments to make about this film would be spoilers .
i will not mention them in the main body of the review but i give mulholland drive a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low 0 on the -4 to +4 scale .
mulholland drive spoiler warning .
i have rated this film fairly low .
you should read this only after seeing the film or deciding that you will not see the film .
david lynch is in large part a dark satirist .
most of his work is done in familiar genres but in some way shows their underside .
in mulholland drive i think he is having a laugh at the expense of the crime film genre .
what he does with this film is
( are you sure you want to read this ? ) playing off the audience expectations that there will be a simple explanation for what is going on .
the first 80 % of the film he tells a simple multi - thread crime story with clues sprinkled throughout .
then suddenly at the end he turns the story on its ear with a large number of clues that appear that they should add up to something .
the audience expectation is that they will add up .
but he has given clues that are self - contradictory .
lynch wants the audience to argue about what they have seen afterward and come up with theories .
in fact , the pointers are noticeably contradictory and until i hear a better explanation , i think lynch is merely playing a joke .
there is a visual curiosity that was popular in the sixties .
mad magazine called it a poiuyt .
other sources called it a tri- pronged u - bar .
look at small portions of it and makes sense .
look at the whole figure and it does not .
this film is , in my estimation , the cinematic equivalent of a tri - pronged u - bar .",0,"['everything that has been built falls apart', 'he just chooses not to', 'strange material added for little reason', 'i am so negative on this film for most of the running time']"
"capsule :
one of the ten worst movies ever made .
christopher lambert vs .
evil ninjas in modern - day japan .
. .
and nobody wins .
the hunted is such a bad movie , so completely inept and so totally brain - damaged that i could almost feel affection for it .
i could see myself showing this movie to friends and getting a good jolly guffaw out of it , if it were n't also insanely xenophobic and insulting
.
christopher lambert plays a computer - parts salesman who 's on business in japan .
he meets a slinky young woman ( joan chen ) and has a torrid night of lovemaking with her -- and then manages to witness her death at the hands of an evil ninja clan and their leader ( john lone ) .
apparently they had some unfinished business that could only be concluded with her getting slaughtered .
since lambert is a witness , he 's of course the next one to die .
let 's stop and think about this for a second .
if lambert were in real life being chased by fanatical devotees to a ninja secret society , he 'd have a lifespan you could only measure with an atomic clock .
in this movie , the ninja manage to kill just about everyone except him .
i imagine the japanese gods smiled down on lambert and provided him with a goof field that radiates out about ten feet from his body .
you know what a goof field is : that invisible zone in which anyone who has intent to do harm to you becomes a klutz no matter what their real dexterity is .
this is , of course , only the beginning of the movie 's problems .
lambert eventually finds pseudo - safety with a long - haired modern - day samurai ( yoshio harada ) and his partner -- yoko shimada , who you may remember as lady toda buntaro in shogun .
they are the two best things in the movie ; in every scene they have authority and presence , and they actually look like they belong here , even when dressed in full samurai armor and wielding bows .
the script does n't know what the hell to do with them .
lone , as the bad guy , is zero - dimensional .
the only bad - guy cliche he has to wallow around in is the one about how the bad guy always has exotic women dripping off of him .
in the hunted , this is elevated to the level of an insulting stereotype .
what 's funny is that the peripheral characters in the hunted are not sterotypes -- there 's a nice little scene with a tokyo cabdriver , and a girl in a pachinko parlor -- but many of the main characters are unsalveageably hateful .
also , the phenomenal instrumental troupe kodo has assembled a superior soundtrack -- get the cd -- that manages to survive
despite the drek it 's been designed to accompany .
there is an extended battle scene in the middle of the movie that is almost reason enough to watch the whole thing -- a gory , excellently staged fight on the bullet train that shows some real imagination for a moment , and then smothers it by trying to clumsily re - couple the whole thing with the movie 's relentlessly stupid plot .
by the time we get to the final showdown , with lambert getting to wield his own sword ( which , judging from the ham - handed editing of one scene , was forged in seven hours or so ) ,
we no longer care .
we 're not even given any definitive information about whether or not one of the key characters lives or dies !
someone once said that the key to good art -- good movies , good books , whatever -- is to start somewhere interesting , end up somewhere interesting , and show respect for the audience all along the way .

"unfortunately it does n't get much more formulaic than one tough cop .
there 's the renegade cop with the loser partner who has to many problems to explain .
the renegade has to prove his good name and is trapped between the good guys , the bad guys and some woman who really has nothing to do with the story other than being there for the purpose of providing sex for the hero in the middle of the film .
bo dietl ( pronounced deedle , baldwin ) is one tough cop , a guy who is being investigated by hardass fbi agents due to his association with the ny mafia .
on top of that problem , he has a drunk , gambling addicted partner ( penn ) who has a penchant for collecting parking tickets ( i guess cops are n't immune ? ) .
then , throw into the mix the femme fatale ( gershon ) .
right there you have plenty of ammo for a decent cop drama .
but right in the middle of the film , they throw in a completely un - related plot point .
dietl and his partner duke try to solve a case that they have been warned to stay away from .
the film spends over half an hour tracking the case of a nun who was beaten and raped to near death .
once the case is solved , the film shifts focus back to the mafia issue .
whatever neat mesh the screenwriter wanted to create between the two stories failed miserably . aside from being asked to accept michael mcglone as a mafioso ( an insult if you ask me ) the performances were pretty good .
baldwin , though he occasionally slips into an impression of his brother alec , does a fine job as one tough cop .
penn , who also slips into an impression of his brother sean , is even better as a loser tough guy cop .
what one tough cop lacks is originality .
this film offers nothing new .
nothing that you ca n't get from any cop film .
it screams sidney lumet all over the place , perhaps because it was produced by marty and michael bregman , producers of lumet 's dog day afternoon and serpico .
but even the masterful sidney would not have been able to make one tough cop into a good film .
too much else is lacking .
i also saw the boom mic pop into the top of the frame twice early on in the picture , something that i almost never notice .
but once i saw that , i had it in the back of my mind every time i saw a medium or long shot .
at times , i was hoping to see it .
one tough cop is n't laughable , nor is it a terrible film , but it just is n't unique .
it is a classic example of a film that did n't need to be made .

"titanic is , without a doubt , the best movie i 've seen all year . and believe me , i 'm not an easy critic to impress : the english patient was too long , men in black was over - hyped , and several of the "" big summer releases "" were dead in the water .
thank god this film got delayed until december .
it 's my christmas present .
titanic is in the tradition of the old hollywood epics of years - gone - by , and
it is truly a stunning film .
while watching this picture you are completely mesmerized , never taking your eyes off the screen , nor checking your watch to see how much longer it 's gon na last , despite its 3 hour plus running time .
as a friend of mine , who 's a true titanic - buff , said "" if someone does n't like this film , it 's because they did n't want to . "" truer words are hard to come by .
of course , it does n't hurt that this film comes from one of my favorite directors , james cameron , who is unarguably the greatest action director of all time .
if you wish to argue that point with me , look at his list of credits : the terminator , aliens , the abyss , terminator 2 , true lies , etc .
still care to disagree ?
not only has cameron helmed the directorial duties of this film , he also wrote , produced , and edited it . and to show his true faith for the project , he renenged all directing fees and percentage points to ease the budget costs .
it 's obvious he truly loves titanic
.
the film opens with footage , both real and fake , of an underwater excursion by special submarines to the bottom of the atlantic , where a team of explorers lead by bill paxton are searcing for a diamond called the "" heart of the ocean "" , which , according to bill paxton 's character , would be worth more than the hope diamond today .
their search turns up , dissapointly , no diamond , but instead a drawing of a young woman wearing the diamond .
this picture is broadcast on cnn and is seen by a 101 year old woman named rose , who claims to be the girl in the picture .
she is flown out to sea to meet bill paxton and to tell them about the diamond .
almost all of the rest of the movie is her narration of the past .
rose 's narration shows us how she was an unhappy young girl , engaged to a rich man named cal hockley ( billy zane ) that she did n't want to marry .
her mother is pushy and obnoxious , and cal hockley is arrogant .
they are boarding the titanic , which is sailing to america , and this is where she is to marry cal .
meanwhile , a young man named jack dawson ( leonardo dicaprio ) and his italian friend ( danny nucci ) win two 3rd class tickets aboard the titanic in a poker game .
they are overjoyed , and rush aboard just as the boat is leaving .
for them , this is their ticket to america , to a better life .
for rose , she is sailing to her doom .
the first hour and a half or so of titanic tells the story of how rose dewitt ( kate winslet ) and jack dawson fall in love .
it 's the classic wrong - side - of - the - tracks story , and does sometimes resort to a few cliches .
but as i said above , the love portion is n't sappy and does n't "" weigh the film down "" , as some critics have said .
it 's sweet , and it did n't make me restless at all , despite the fact that i usually hate love stories .
of course , it might help that cameron introduces some pretty interesting characters to help keep our eyes glued to the screen
.
most of these people actually were passengers on the titanic back in 1912 , including the enigmatic molly brown ( played by the talented kathy bates ) , the captain of titanic ( bernard hill ) , and so on .
all of these characters add an extra depth to the film , and make it that easier to watch .
of course , things really start to get going
after the hour and a half mark , where the titanic strikes the iceberg and begins a slow sink to the bottom .
the sinking is depicted realisticly , and the effects are truly amazing .
it is not told in a heroic fashion sense either , as people are portrayed as panicking , pushing others aside to get on the limited lifeboats , and drowning and dying horrible deaths .
the best part of the movie , in my opinion , comes at the very end , when we flash back to the future .
the crew , who at first had been skeptical of rose 's story , now are totally aborbed by her .
rose goes out onto the ship 's ledge , and we then learn a secret about her that catches us off guard .
we then see a dream of rose 's , in which she returns to the titanic and is dancing with jack dawson .
most people i talked with after the movie saw this as only a dream .
however , i think it symbolized more ; i think it meant that rose had died , and is going to a sort of heaven , which would be the happiest part of her life :
her and her one true love , jack .

""" gordy "" is not a movie , it is a 90-minute - long "" sesame street "" skit , and a very bad one at that .
this movie is so stupid and dumb that it 's depressing to think that some hollywood executives actually gave this the green light , and even more surprising is the fact that this is a disney movie .
i 'm sure children are the target audience of this movie , but only kids under the age of five may be able to tolerate it .
it is the story of a farm a piglet named gordy ( voiced by garms ) , whose family has been taken away to "" up north , "" which we know means death .
of course we can hear the animals talk to each other , and they actually went to the trouble of attempting to sync the voices with their mouths but
it comes out terrible .
actually , it 's almost funny in a way .
the only remotely interesting and likable character soon appears , a little girl named jinnie sue macallister ( young ) who sees gordy on the back of a truck and essentially steals him .
jinnie is a country singer and the film goes off on a huge tangent to show her little concert and the people dancing to it .
what is the point of this ?
maybe she is one of the producer 's relatives and they wanted to show her on camera to promote her or something .
we then cut to a huge social gathering and drop in on another young kid named hank royce ( roescher ) who is sad because his divorced mother is dating .
he leaves the party and meets jinnie sue , but he accidentally falls in a pool ( probably because he was sitting on the diving board with a $ 200 suit on - nah , did n't see that one coming ! ) , starts to drown , and is miraculously saved as gordy pushes an inflatable float over to him and saves him .
if this had not been insanely stupid already the story quickly changes when jinnie gives gordy to hank who then ends up becoming the ceo of a food processing corporation when hank 's grandfather , the original ceo , dies and leaves his fortune to hank . . .
and gordy !
of course there must be a villain , but even this villain ( donadio as sipes ) is n't that evil .
he never raises his voice or becomes angry , and of course he has the typical idiot goons kidnap gordy but
this is just so beyond stupid and cartoony we are constantly two steps ahead of the story .
it 's hard to tell whether the overall corniness and cheesiness to the movie is intentional because it is a family film , or if the filmmaker 's are just this untalented and stupid .
at times "" gordy "" is tolerable to watch , thus earning it one star and not the dreaded "" z- .
""
but it 's just so unbelievably boring , cliche , dumb , unfunny , corny , and just plain bad it may scare children , it certainly disturbed me .

"plot : odin is a great high school basketball player .
he 's dating a hot girl and the coach loves his ass .
in fact , the coach even admits to having fatherly feelings towards him .
unfortunately , the coach 's real son , hugo , is n't too pleased to hear that .
in fact , he does n't like hearing about any of odin 's triumphs , as they generally supersede his own .
so what does he set out to do ?
well , let 's just say that he starts to mess with people 's heads and one thing leads to another thing which leads to .
. .
well , you 'll see .
critique : a very powerful , thoroughly depressing , well - acted "" non - teen "" movie starring a bunch of teens .
credit director tim blake nelson for creating a modern day version of this shakespearian classic , set in a realistic high school environment , with the basketball championships as the backdrop and an impending sense of doom as it core .
you also have to give it up to all of the actors in this film , who turn over some very convincing performances , taking you through all of their characters ' ups and downs .
hartnett especially should be applauded for taking on such a despicable character , a dude who you just want to grab by the throat and beat the shit out of ( sign of a good actor , if you ask me ) .
phifer also comes to play in this movie , with a nice blend of charisma , fear , love and anger spread over his character .
i was always on this guy 's side and definitely felt sorry for him as things moved along .
julia stiles was also good , but her character was n't much different from others that she 's played recently .
i was however very surprised with martin sheen 's showing , since i had n't taken him too seriously as an actor over the past few years .
his character is definitely over - the - top in this film , but i appreciated his fervor , his rage , his ultimate and blind desire to win above all .
a great example of a workaholic man who can not see the trees from the forest .
i did have a few reservations about the movie though .
first of all , what was with all of the gangsta hip - hop music used in pretty much every other scene transition ?
it was cute at first , but became a little too obvious and annoying after a few times .
the film was also edited pretty choppily . . .
like some scenes were cut out and no one "" cleaned it up "" afterwards .
i also did n't like the fact that hartnett 's character , the man behind much of the nastiness that goes down in this film , was infallible .
in other words , pretty much everything he says or asks of someone , happens automatically and without any goofups .
i mean , i know the guy is smart and all , but i would have appreciated a little more "" realism "" under some of the circumstances .
but overall , the movie will devastate you .
it 's not a "" fun date movie "" .
it 's not a movie about the high school basketball team and how its black star falls for the white girl from the other side of the tracks .
it 's about jealousy , love , envy , fury , passion , revenge and pretty much any other negative thought that 's ever passed through your head .
is it worth seeing ?
oh , most definitely !
( pun intended ) it 's a moving picture with great performances , no shakespearian speak ( thank you , god ! ) and an outstanding directorial job by nelson .
the final scene alone is enough to send a massive chill down your spine , and i was especially impressed with the director 's choice of music near the end .
in fact , the whole sequence was quite reminiscent of the final showdown scene from taxi driver , and i guess that 's saying something right there .

"a sci fi / comedy starring jack nicholson , pierce brosnan , annette benning , glenn close , martin short and other stars .
a warner bros picture the martians have landed in this hillarous tim burton movie .
before entering the cinema , i was initially a little bit nervous about what this film would be like .
many people were saying that this film was silly rubbish , and there was no point to it all .
how wrong they were .
i left this film feeling much happier than i was before i entered the cinema .
the story is about martians attacking earth .
using ray guns ( hooray ! )
they generally cause havoc around the u . s and other countries .
nicholson plays the president who must try to stop invasion , and also taking advice from his loopy officials .
but , basically , its a load of set pieces showing the martians destroying earth .
the way people are killed by the ray guns is great , they is a hillarous ( and mildly disturbing scene ) involving a martian lady , a mad general who just wants to nuke the aliens away , ( and ends up getting squashed by an aliens foot ) and a gory finale involving lots of alien heads exploding .
but , most of all , this film is fun .
the martians are full of character , the performances are spot on , and the all star cast help make the film more enjoyable
.
the film is a million times better

"_ in brief : _ this film needs no introduction . if you have n't heard of it , then you must have been up in space on a sabbatical , and if you have n't seen it -- well , i suspect you 're in a small minority !
first thing 's first ?
is it all it 's hyped up to be ?
well , yes ?
and no .
it 's a good film , and there 's a lot to like about it , but it 's not without its problems .
when i saw the first trailer for "" titanic "" , it was when i went to see "" bean "" last summer , i think , my intial reaction was --
ai n't that downright sick to make a disaster movie out of such a dreadful , real - life tragedy ? !
i mean , what 's happened to hollywood 's script - writers , have they run entirely out of new ideas ?
gads ,
whatever next , i asked myself , how about an action film based on hiroshima starring jean claude van damme ?
i was not entirely filled with anticipation , but then i was n't alone in that respect .
it 's when it came out in the cinema , to rave reviews ( well , mostly ) and
anyone who 'd been to see it seemed disturbingly obsessed by it that i started to take notice !
i did n't see the film until several months after its release ( by which time my sister had seen it about four times ! ) , so i went with a slightly more open mind , but i still did n't think i 'd enjoy it much .
did i ?
yes
and no .
mainly yes , i 'm happy to say .
the first hour or so was beautifully done , not so much because of the scripting
( i 'll talk about that later ? ) but because the re - created ship and sets were stunning to look at , as was cameron 's directing , and the performances of the principal cast were so strong that the "" human "" aspect of the story , the romance between rose ( kate winslet ) and jack ( leonardo dicaprio ) , was enchanting
.
the film is told via flashback , with gloria stuart playing the elderly rose in the modern day ( you knew that , a ' course ! : - ) ) .
well , it 's an often effective device to use in storytelling -- though sometimes it can fall flat .
does it work here ?
in script form it does n't add all that much to the story .
what does add a lot to the story is gloria stuart , whose stunning performance is the strongest , most moving of the film .
her presence brings a much deeper level of passion , and depth to the story , and though her appearances are relatively brief , the film would have suffered without her . also impressive are dicaprio and winslet , who wholly succeed in rising above the often poor dialogue , and the bond they form is both heartfelt and moving
.
it 's an old story , you know -- forbidden love ala romeo and juliet -- but it works , and jack 's "" rescuing "" rose ( in both literal and figurative senses ) and teaching her to live life for what counts was pointed and touching .
in fact , i enjoyed the first half of the film a lot , largely because winslet and dicaprio bring such and charm , energy to the romance .
it 's engaging , touching and very enjoyable .
there 's more than a tinge of poignancy to it as well ,
simply because you know it 's not going to be a happy ending .
which leads us to the second half of the film .
we all knew it was coming .
i 'm sure director cameron was looking forward with eager anticipation to it , because as he 's stated in interviews , the real thrust of the story ( for him ) was the sinking , and the jack / rose romance was a merely a manipulative plot device to get you emotionally into the film .
i think that understates the importance of the romance , as i found it far more enjoyable than an hour of watching people die .
the iceberg arrives , and the captain announces that titanic will have sunk in about an hour .
and it is an hour .
my goodness , we do n't miss a second of that hour ?
gratuitous ?
well , perhaps not by today 's standards , i 'm sure there 's been far worse produced under the banner of "" entertainment "" in other films .
but i certainly was n't prepared for how shocking and graphic the last hour or so would be .
not that i 'd expect the word "" understatement "" to be part of cameron 's vocabulary ( he who brought us such , umm , vivid films as "" terminator 2 "" and "" aliens "" ) .
is it overdone ?
i thought so .
understatement can sometimes work wonders in conveying tragedy .
no , no one expected a happy ending , but i did n't quite expect the horrendously shocking and powerful scenes we were bombarded throughout the film 's second half .
still , whether it was overdone and heavy - handed or not , if it was the shock - factor cameron was after it worked , because i was shocked and moved , in fact i spent most of the last hour in tears !
you really could n't help but get emotionally involved ,
whether it was wishing someone would knock that dreadfully psychotic fiance of rose 's overboard or desperately hoping that rose would rescue jack , or that jack would rescue rose , or that they would both survive .
perhaps the most harrowing scene was when the ship has sunk , and those that sunk along with the ship freeze to death on the water surface .
the bit where rose lets go of jack 's hand , while promising she 'll never let go in her heart was particularly heart - wrenching , and the sight of rescue boats sailing amid the ocean of corpses was a pretty powerful image , to put no fine a point on it .
i loved the ending , however , which was both moving and slightly uplifting following the horror of the past hour and a half .
so , we 've established that the film is powerful and moving , if the last hour was rather excessive . have n't mentioned the script .
plot - wise
it 's ok , though the jack / rose relationship was beautifully developed
,
but i 've a feeling that 's to the actors
credit if anything .
as for the dialogue ?
well , titanic is set in 1912 .
it 's a period drama .
but i saw very little indication of period in so far as the dialogue is concerned .
did they really use phrases like "" goddamn it !
"" back in the turn of the century ?
i doubt it .
would someone talk like this : "" do ya love the guy or what ? "" .
i doubt it .
is such dialogue as "" i saw the iceberg , and i see it in your eyes now
"" not just a bit ? clumsy ?
yes it is .
a little more attention to dialogue would not have gone astray , and cameron himself is to blame ( he wrote the script ) .
stick with directing , dude .
but its more than redeemed by the acting , with dicaprio and winslet on fine form , ably supported by a strong cast .
star of the show was gloria stuart , though --
why did n't she win that oscar ? !
after all , they were throwing oscars at "" titanic "" left , right and centre , but gloria was perhaps the most deserving nominee . directing - wise cameron does a spectacular job .
like i said , his vision was a bit excessive , but at least he directed it well .
i have n't even mentioned james horner 's beautiful score .
utterly heavenly , though when your dad and sister play the soundtrack a lot you do start to get a bit bored with it !
; - ) i 've finished my rant , which lasted a lot longer than i thought it would !
just leaves a couple of questions ; was it worth all those oscars ?
hell , do n't talk to me about oscars .
bloomin ' farce .
it was deserving in a number of departments , though .
last question ; is it , as some suggest , one of the best films of all - time ?
nope , i do n't think so .
it 's certainly one of the most powerful and memorable films i 've ever seen ,
but i do n't think it quite ranks as one of my all - time favourites .
and as for the fact they 're reportedly making a "" titanic 2 "" ?

"lucas was wise to start his star wars trilogy with episode 4 : episode 1 is a boring , empty spectacle that features some nice special effects .
after the familiar ' a long time ago . . . . '
opening , the film starts with the opening yellow crawl that features in every star wars movie and computer game .
the plot is that the trade confederation are blocking off supplies to the peaceful planet of naboo , ruled by queen amidala ( portman ) jedi knights qui - gon ( neeson ) and obi wan ( mcgregor ) are sent to negotiate a deal with the confederation to stop the blockade .
however , this simple blockade is not all it seems , and the jedi knights soon have to deal with many more dangers , including facing the evil darth maul ( ray park . )
they also meet the future darth vadar , anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd )
star wars is largely a failure in all the major areas of filmmaking
: script , direction and characters .
the script desperately tries to make an thin and boring story into a two hour epic .
the trade confederation plot is just not as exciting as the death star , and as the film goes on the drama becomes more and more non - existent
.
there 's no underlying tension , and no urgent need to see what the outcome is .
the film also takes a leisurely pace in telling the boring story , which does n't help .
there 's no snap to make the film work ,
it moves at a plod .
the script is boring
: all the characters speak in morals , especially anakins mother .
there 's no group spirit evident here , and when all characters can speak only in profound statements or bark orders , it 's evident that not much is going to happen .
the two leads are hideously boring , static characters given little to do and too much time to do it .
qui - gon and obi - wan
hold no presence on film , and give little for the audience to root for .
the audience will probably warm more to bad guy darth maul , if he had been given more screen time .
maul is one of the most underused bad guys in film history , even if he does provide the only ' straight ' plot line in the film ( all the other plots in this film are to be concluded throughout the trilogy . )
anakin is annoying and unlikeable . , instead of cute and huggable as lucas no doubt intended .
it 's probably not surprising that his hateful little boy , unfortunately blessed ' ani ' by everyone he knows , joins the dark side and kills everyone as quickly as possible .
the comedy relief is supposedly provided by the gangly jar jar brinks , although in the end none is provided in the film by him .
although his floppy features will no doubt be great for stuffed toys , the lines and actions he is given are painfully unfunny .
the only good laugh is when his tongue is burned by a ' pod ' racer , because i knew he would n't be able to talk for a while .
queen amidala is a nothing in the film , she serves no real purpose apart from the fact that she must ' serve her people , ' and go goo - goo over anakin .
again , her role will become more important in the later episodes , and is given little to do here .
the actors do n't help the movie much either .
liam neeson seems bored and embarrassed , and seems desperate to leave the movie as quickly as possible .
mcgregor comes across as a posh mothers boy , with little charm .
the casting director must have chose him because he 's scottish like alec guinness : there 's little other explanation for it .
natalie portman is plagued by hideous costumes and a poor script , but she delivers a spunky performance . and jake lloyd looks at everyone with hateful eyes and delivers his lines in a bored voice .
there 's very little talent
evident with him , it 's hard to see why lucas chose him when there are better child actors out there .
he 's not even very ' cute . '
the main claim of the film , the special effects , are okay .
there 's nothing impressive about them , yet they complement the story well .
the cgi takes away much of the human element , however .
the battle droids for example , the replacement for the stormtroopers , are characterless little computer graphics , lacking the humour and humanness that came from the stormtroopers .
episode 1 is just disappointing .
it 's got high production values , but little else .
the music is meandering , except near the end .
the plot gives us no - one to root for , or even care for .
the effects are nice , but dull .
the plot goes on for half an hour longer than it should .
there 's an air of manufacturing among the whole sorry affair , and many clich ?

what is this , a homicide or a bad b - movie ?
""
that is the prophetic question asked by one of the leads in one of the early scenes of this movie .
let me clear things up for you cupcake ,
this is n't a bad b - movie , it 's a really bad b - movie .
so bad , it 's almost good .
almost , but not quite .
the movie starts off in the 1950 's with space aliens sending a botched experiment down to earth .
it is a bunch of slug - like creatures that kill people and take over their bodies .
the slugs ' first and only victim in the fifties is cryogenically frozen where he is of no danger to anybody .
that is , until two loser university students unfreeze him in 1986 .
he , and the slugs inside him , promptly begin wreaking havoc and turning more co - eds into slug zombies .
a slightly crazed cop ( tom atkins ) and the requisite girl with the face of an angel ( jill whitlow ) join these two geeky university students ( jason lively and steve marshall ) to do battle with the slugs .
it more or less falls on the four of them to make the world safe again from the evil slugs .
the acting is bad with a capital b .
the story is worse .
and the special effects are somewhere between an old rerun of star trek and what you see in a home movie .
the only saving grace was the requisite tit - shot courtesy of jill whitlow .
it had absolutely nothing to do with the story -- but i liked it .
actually , it was the high point of the movie for me .
of course , that is n't really saying much .
the story moves around in a hap hazard fashion .
which gives it a leg up on some other horror films .
unlike most movies of this genre , there actually is a story .
not a great one , but it is there .
this is one in a long line of movies from the 1980 's that were thrown together to capitalize off the success of the friday the 13th , halloween and nightmare on elm street movies .
you could randomly select a movie out of the horror section of you local video store and probably luck into something just as good if not better .
but night of the creeps might make a nice addition to a b - movie horror marathon .
just do n't be too upset if you ca n't find it .
you really wo n't be missing that much .",0,"['the story is worse . and the special effects are somewhere between an old rerun of star trek and what you see in a home movie', 'moves around in a hap hazard fashion', 'the acting is bad', ""you really wo n't be missing that much"", ""this is n't a bad b - movie , it 's a really bad b - movie . so bad , it 's almost good . almost , but not quite""]"
"writer / director lawrence kasdan had a hand in penning some of the biggest film successes of the 1980s .
yes , that 's right
, he co - wrote raiders of the lost ark ( 9/10 )
, the empire strikes back ( 8 . 5/10 ) and return of the jedi ( 8/10 ) .
now with this film , it looks as though he has decided to test his skills at mediocre screenwriting and bland directing .
and guess what ?
he succeeds once again !
plot : a man with a shady and regrettable past decides to run away and into a small american town , where he pretends to be a licensed psychologist to an open - armed swarm of people with problems .
it is n't long before he befriends the small - town billionaire , folks become suspicious and he falls for one of his own patients .
critique : this film is not a comedy !
it is a drama .
i say this right up front because from the looks of the trailer , you would think that this film secures its base in humor , but unfortunately for us , it does not .
it is a serious film ( seriously flawed if you ask me , but i digress ) which offers a couple of witty quips to keep you awake , but overall , just sits there .
now on to my review .
this movie sucks because it was slow and boring
, starred an uninteresting protagonist with an unbelievable past , included extremely dull patients whose problems left me indifferent at best and
pissed at worst , and certified it all with many a predictable ending .
i have no idea what lawrence kasdan was trying to accomplish with this picture , but whatever it was . . .
he missed !
anyone without his name could never have made this film because it is an extremely generic puff - piece , which on a good day , might be described as predictably digestible .
it 's no wonder that the studio is trying to sell it as a comedy !
it sucks as a drama , and bored my movie cohort right to sleep .
i 've given it four points on four
extremely shallow yet distinguishable marks .
first of all , i could n't help but think about how much the lead actor , loren dean , looked like a young charles grodin .
he even acted like him , save for the dry , sardonic wit .
this kept me interested in watching him at least .
number two , and
this one is really shallow ( seemed to be geared that way as well ) , there were quite a few "" titshots "" , as they would say back in high school .
and god help me if i ca n't get enough of those in an aimless drama .
and three , and this one surprised me the most , actor ted danson 's cameo ( yes , he will always be sam malone to us real fans !
) was the best part about this movie and actually made me see him as a different person .
a different asshole , but a different person nonetheless .
if ever you rent this movie one day ( promise you wo n't throw away your hard - earned money at the theaters ? ! ) , wait for his scene because it 's actually pretty good .
other than that , drab , drab , drab and drab .
even jason lee , a personal favorite of mine , was left out to dry with lame dialogue and one of the phoniest romances to hit the big screen in a while .
well , at least he finally "" came out "" and did some real skateboarding in this movie !
oh yeah ,
and i guess that 's the fourth point in my rating .
anyway , if you enjoy watching boring patients babble on about their boring problems to an uninteresting psychologist . . .
this film 's your bag !
otherwise , skip it and see analyze this ( 8/10 ) again .
. .
now there 's a great shrink movie !
little known facts about this film and its stars : "" three 's company "" fans alert ! ! !
terri from the tv show , also known as actress priscilla barnes , plays a small but pivotal part as the landlady in this film .
the scene is actually a fantasy sequence and does feature cleavage , so stay tuned , kids !
also , it is to note that the actress was once named "" penthouse pet of the month "" in march of 1976 .
she was known as one joann witty back then .
she 's originally from jersey .
who the hell is loren dean , the dude who plays mumford in this film ?
you got me , but all i know is that he was born in las vegas in 1969 and played the character of billy bathgate in the 1991 film of the same name .
jason lee was born in the state of california in the year of 1971 .
he was a professional skateboarder before his acting career took off after mallrats ( 6/10 ) , and even owns his own skateboarding company called stereo manufacturing corp .
he 's been in every kevin smith film except for clerks ( 8 . 5/10 ) .
listen closely and you will hear the pharmacist in this film
( the ballooning actor formerly known as pruit taylor vince ) make a reference to the "" lost ark "" , which is obviously an in - joke , considering that it is the writer / director of this film , lawrence kasdan , who co - wrote raiders of the lost ark ( 9/10 ) .
kasdan also played the part of dr .
green in 1997 's as good as it gets
( 8/10 ) .
ted danson also played the role of lawyer peter lowenstein in kasdan 's 1981 directorial debut body heat starring a sexy kathleen turner and william hurt .",0,"['seriously flawed', 'extremely dull', 'starred an uninteresting protagonist with an unbelievable past', 'certified it all with many a predictable ending', 'he has decided to test his skills at mediocre screenwriting and bland directing', 'this movie sucks because it was slow and boring', 'left out to dry with lame dialogue and one of the phoniest romances', 'boring patients babble on about their boring problems to an uninteresting psychologist', 'bored my movie cohort right to sleep', 'pissed at worst', 'other than that , drab , drab , drab and drab', 'it sucks as a drama', 'it is an extremely generic puff - piece']"
"of circumcision , psychic wounds and the family sitcom the opening segment is something of a foretaste of this film .
there 's a guy 's voice telling us how he tries to imagine what his biological parents look like , and on the screen we see images of a variety of oldish men and women .
as his imagination plays o n , he ( and we ) picture these motley characters in a mix - and - match shuffle of unlikely marriages , businesswomen with bums , matrons with paint salesmen , the images coming on in a faster and faster frenzy .
it 's not just a witty , funny summing up of the film 's themes - you might not guess it yet , but it sets the pattern for the way the story goes on .
what starts out as a step in a fairly sensible direction , gets taken on a road trip , put through a detour or two and finds itself freewheeling towards an immin ent crash .
that may not sound so different from the average family sitcom , and the general idea of the film does n't , at first , seem so wildly distant from standard - issue hollywood comedy : man who was adopted as a child ( ben still er ) sets out on a journey to meet his real parents , along with his wife ( patricia arquette ) , his baby , and a pretty psychology - researcher ( tea leoni ) in tow .
various mix - ups , shenanigans , oddball characters and , yup , disasters follow .
but if you think you 've been here before , the dialogue and the direction ( by david o . russell , who made spanking the monkey ) take it into another dimension .
the dreaded t - name seems an inevitable reference point ( what with a drug overdose scene and the casting of arquette from true romance ) but really the point is that the foot - massage master has n't got a monopoly on plot twists and fast , funny , irreverent lines , or on the absurdities of ordinary speech .
whether it 's about circumcision , psychic wounds , oral sex , carjacking , the beauties of the armpit area , or ronald reagan , the script never seems to run out of hilarious invention .
the best thing is how these words are n't just there for the punchlines , but are great precisely because they 're said in character , like tea leoni 's neurotically - charged psychobabbler who 's able to say under assault , "" it 's understandable if you find this threatening "" .
the cast is excellent throughout , and , rather than singling out anybody , kudos are due to the fine ensemble acting , with the sometimes frenetically overlapping dialogue and the sense of a dozen different reagents colliding to the point of fission .
there are some elements of a woody allen film in this ( not to mention the hand - held camera and loose , improvisational feel of some scenes ) .
like allen , russell 's interests are in the volatile sexual politics of couples and the neurotic obsessions in both pare nts and children ( and everybody , really ) .
still , if you 're expecting a privileged moment of revelation and emotional outpouring a la "" murphy brown "" / "" frasier "" / fill - in - the - blank - american - comedy , well , it wo n't happen .
the film sets up expectations like these , with the lead character 's search f or his origins and his hopes of self - healing , only to knock them down .
if the conventional sitcom structure is to put a slightly loopy family in catastrophic conditions only to rediscover their essential lovey one - ness , flirting with disaster 's charact ers embark on a journey to seek that essential state but find themselves only plunging into more weirdness and dysfunctional chaos the further they go .
and that , the film suggests , is the essential family state - and you better learn to love it .
somehow , this is perversely feelgood cinema , right up to its manic end .",1,"['the script never seems to run out of hilarious invention', 'the fine ensemble acting', 'the cast is excellent throughout', 'plot twists and fast , funny , irreverent lines']"
"i have to say it .
tim burton 's retelling of planet of the apes is more fun than a barrel of monkeys .
ok , that 's off my chest .
no more monkey puns , i promise .
seriously , though , planet of the apes is one rip - roarin ' summer outing , filled with thrills , action , adventure , wit and bits of funny
( dare i say , monkey ) business .
i know , i know
, i promised .
and for those film buffs who are fond of the original , burton 's version includes a couple tips of the hat to that movie .
mark wahlberg stars as capt . leo davidson , a deep - space pilot whose ship gets drawn into a magnetic field and hurled into the future .
he crash lands on a planet where apes are the dominant species and humans are hunted , captured and sold into slavery .
despite being darker than the original , burton 's film is not as heavy handed nor as sanctimonious .
some of the movie 's flashes of humor are surreal as well as typically burton : an organ - grinder ape with a midget or an elderly ape taking off a wig and removing false teeth as he prepares for bed .
then there are the parents who buy a little girl as a pet for there young daughter .
the seller advises the parents to get rid of the girl before she reaches puberty : "" one thing you do n't want in your house is a human teen - ager , "" he says .
you do n't have to be an ape to realize the truth in that statement .
touches such as these are what stamps this movie with burton 's brand .
lines that hearken back to the original movie are sprinkled throughout : the first words spoken by an ape to davidson as the astronaut is regaining consciousness and grabs the simian 's foot to try righting himself are : "" take your stinking hand off of me , you damned , dirty human .
""
anyone familiar with the first version of the film will , of course , recognize the irony in that piece of dialogue .
another of burton 's in - jokes is to have charlton heston , star of the original , play the chimpanzee father of tim roth 's gen .
thade .
the young chimp goes to visit his dying father .
both have one thing in common , a hatred of humans .
with his dying breath , the elder spews out his vile : "" damn them , damn them all to hell , "" he says before expiring .
that is the famous line heston 's taylor shouted at the conclusion of the original after discovering the planet 's terrible secret .
the performances throughout are top - notch .
wahlberg plays davidson not as some gung - ho hero , but as a confused and somewhat frightened explorer who only wants to return home .
he is reluctant to lead the human rebellion ; his only objective being to find a way off this upside - down planet .
this hesitation is what makes his character believable and vulnerable .
roth is ferocious , cunning , cruel and savage as the fascist chimp who wants to rid his planet of all vestiges of humanity .
he leaps and bounds as if he had springs on his feet .
it is a masterful turn .
helena bonham carter is ari , the chimp who believes that apes and humans can live in peace and as equals .
hers is a smart , compassionate characterization .
michael clarke duncan is big and brutal as attar the gorilla aid to thade who blindly follows his leader until his faith is shaken .
a fine comic outing is given by paul giamatti as limbo , the ape slave trader making a living off the misery of the humans he captures .
as the battle between apes and humans looms , the cowardly limbo pleads , "" ca n't we all just get along , "" echoing the words of rodney king .
much of the success of planet of the apes goes to burton 's technical crew , especially production designer rick heinrichs and the legendary rick baker who created the ape makeup .
burton 's musical collaborator , danny elfman , provides another fine score , though it is not as memorable as his work on batman or sleepy hollow .
the movie 's only letdown comes at the very end where burton tries to outshock the finale from the 1968 original .
he comes close , but falls short .
otherwise , planet of the apes is what a summer movie should be : an amusement park ride filled with lots of action , stunts and a few laughs .
this is one feature in which the expectations lived up to the pre - release hype .",1,"['is more fun than a barrel of monkeys', 'the expectations lived up to the pre - release hype', 'the legendary', ""one rip - roarin ' summer outing , filled with thrills , action , adventure , wit and bits of funny"", 'the performances throughout are top - notch', 'it is a masterful turn', 'an amusement park ride', 'another fine score']"
"eric rohmer 's "" pauline at the beach , "" is one of those small , deliberately paced , but charming foreign films in which not much happens plot wise , but a lot happens to the characters emotionally .
the film takes place during a few weeks of august at the normandy coast , and centers on six different characters , primarily pauline ( amanda langlet ) , a wise beyond her years 15-year - old who has come to stay for the summer with her older cousin , marion ( arielle dombasle ) .
on the first day at the beach , marion runs into an old high school flame ( fedoore atkine ) , and although he wants to rekindle their relationship , she is more interested in an older , more seductive womanizer ( pascal greggory ) , who is also secretly having an affair with a candy vendor ( rosette ) .
while pauline watches as an outsider at what is happening between all of the adults , she forms a relationship of her own with a young teenage boy ( simon de la brosse ) .
"" pauline at the beach , "" is not a film in which big dramatic things occur , and there is not a clear - cut , tidy conclusion to the story .
instead , it is a picture that simply observes its characters in every day life , and the surprises come from little character details .
the film is quite talky and slow moving , and so it is pretty safe to say it is n't for those who are only a fan of action movies , but is a treat for those viewers who often like to venture outside of the big - budget genre and see a good art film .
this is the first film by acclaimed director eric rohmer ( 1969 's "" my night at mauds , "" and 1971 's "" claire 's knee "" ) that i have seen , but his direction is assured and intelligent , as is the screenplay , which he also wrote .

"it may seem weird to begin a film about glam rock with a sequence that includes a spaceship , a green ovular pin , and the birth of oscar wilde , but if one really strains , they can see that perhaps maybe these connections are not half off .
wilde 's philosophy was that everyone should be true to their own human nature , and the result of his following this philosophy was that he was imprisoned , loosing his family and his career .
the glam rock movement in the early 70s in england had a similar take and came to a similar demise .
the main difference was by placing makeup on their face and acting out on their deepest fantasies and inquiries about life ( mostly dealing with androgony and sexuality ) , they became less and less like themselves and more and more like everyone else .
and that 's why the movement seemed to end as soon as it began .
it 's been said that todd haynes ' "" velvet goldmine , "" the film that chronicles what it was like to be a part of the movement , not only from those who experienced it but by those who created it , steals a lot from "" citizen kane , "" and that 's true .
in the film , a british journalist in the 80s , arthur stuart ( christian bale ) , is asked to go back and find out what happened to 70s glam rock star brian slade , a fictitious rock star , who faked his own death on stage , bringing the end not only to his career but to the entire glam rock movement .
structure - wise
, this totally steals from "" kane , "" not only from the set - up ( he interviews three people , and the story is a result of their flashbacks ) , but in other things , like the beginning ( death , then newsreel ) , and smaller details , like the bitter ex - friend in a wheelchair and the bitter ex - wife as a washed - up lounge singer , found in a bar after hours .
this is no "" kane , "" and it really does n't aspire to be : it does n't attempt to be the deep outlook of something gone like "" kane "" did , and it does n't really uncover anything poignant about humanity .
instead , it uses the flashbacks as a form of contrast between the magic that was the glam rock era and the boredom that was life after glam rock for those who were participants .
the 80s scenes are dry and deliriously melancholy , equipped with a performance by bale that is perhaps appropriately dull and unengaging .
but the 70s scenes are engaging , though , not to mention addictively campy .
they radiate with gorgeous cinematography
that nicely accentuates all the vibrant colors of the era , and a feel that 's so eerily lighthearted that when combined with the then - footage , they become not only a symbol of decadence , but of times when everything seemed so simple .
instead of creating the world the way it was , haynes paints their own world as if it were a narcotic fairy tale : the glam rock movement was full of so much freedom and liberation that after you 've experienced it , everything else seems so mundane .
there 's no outside world to speak of , secluding these people inside a protective globe that will eventually crack .
haynes focuses his story on the tale of blade and the other fictitious rock hero , curt wild , and their relationship that created , molded , and then brought down the movement , reducing everyone else who contributed to it as merely that - contributors .
blade - played with reserve by the pouty jonathan
rhys meyers - and wild - played with anarchic wildness by ewan mcgregor - are little more than thinly disguised recreations of david bowie and iggy pop , respectively , complete with the creation of a ziggy stardust persona named maxwell demon and the confirmation that the two rock stars may have
very well not only have been one - time partners in music , but also partners in bed .
through discussions with slade 's ex - manager cecil ( michael feast ) , ex - wife mandy ( toni collette , reinventing herself as an american blonde dish who fakes a british accent when with slade ) , and finally ex - partner wild , journalist stuart begins to remember his own experiences in the era , like his discovery of his rebelliousness cum conformity , including the moment when he began questioning his own sexuality ( when he opens up his first slade record , he finds a naked and green slade lying on a crimson blanket ) , and finally running away from home to be part of the london scene , finally resulting in leading a boring job in america .
haynes demonstrates that he 's quite the visual auteur , molding scenes that are like long heald breaths , such as a seemingly long sequence juxtaposing a slade / wild concert of them performing a brian eno cover , "" baby 's on fire , "" with scenes from a decadent drug party ; and the film 's most wow - inspiring sequence , the first concert scene of wild with his band , the ratttz , where mcgregor lets loose so much anarchic steam that his wild iggy - esuqe movements ( including stripping naked ) and screams that the film captures that perfect moment when one discovers a major talent , and another ( slade ) discovers his idle .
even the brief music videos , spoofs of bowie 's , have a rare visual flair that 's pure camp , and which would cause ken russell to drool .
the best sequence , though , may be the beginning , following the prelude , a sequence which acts as the middle ground for both the actual being of the movement and the post - movement era .
in it , stuart and his mates are going to the infamous slade concert where he fakes his own death , where he kills off his alter ego maxwell demon in what appears to be a real assasination , which brought about the end of the era in one swift fake bullet .
with brian eno 's famous "" needle in the camel 's eye "" playing in the background , the scene has a detached exhileration - the song does n't seem to be played in quite the same way the other songs are .
it has a distance that 's hard to put a finger on , and it seems to represent that all this is coming to a quick and sad ending , and when one sees slade in the dressing room before the show , docked in a silver frock with wings and blue hair , depressingly staring into the mirror , it comes off as a none - too - obvious prophecy of the finale in the beginning of the film .
this movie 's not so much about plot , but more about the way it is presented , making this one of those films which is classified as being "" style over substance , "" a statement which prompts many critics to line up for attack .
however , for the most part , the engaging part of this film is not the story but rather the way in which haynes creates this world , by using his sets , costumes , cinematography , and especially the music to play as characters in his film .
the music is especially notable .
the soundtrack , which is wall to wall , consists of old school glam rock tunes by the likes of brian eno , t - rex , and roxy music , as well as covers by slade 's band ( with vocals by thom yorke , and occasionally rhys meyers himself ) , and even newer music by shudder to think that sounds uncannily bowie - like .
the cast is rather impressive , but no one really walks away with the film , and no performances are extremely good .
although eddie izzard , as slade 's manager ( who challenges slade 's first manager to an arm - wrestling match to see who gets control of his career ) and michael feast as the first and tragic manager come off greatly , and collette and mcgregor have their moments , rhys meyers and bale are noticably sub - par , neither putting a lot of effort into their respective roles .
some of it is at fault with the actual construction of the film by haynes .
rhys meyers ' brian slade remains merely a metaphor for the glam rock era , dying when he turned into a retro - garbo , resorting to a life of salinger - ism , and found in the mid-70s to be lying around , sniffing coke off the ass of a party girl .
in fact , no one in this film is really seen as a person , rather than just as a symbol or composite of a type who thrived during the era .
bale 's character is an especially tough sell : bitter and depressed by flashbacks to his young adulthood , he 's not an extremely personal character , and his cliched experiences ( being hounded by the record store guys for buying a record put out by a "" poof "" ) never help us communicate with him .
nevertheless , rhys meyers and mcgregor have the excuses that their characters are not really characters but rather the results of an era that has left them , and others , bitter , part of which helps the film work , since this is a major piece of eye candy .
at the prime of the movie , they at least look the role of fashionable leaders - slade with his perpetually - changing , androgonys persona , and wild with his topless and unpredictable image , which clash and fuse into an unstable union .
their story - of how slade was so influenced by wild that he adapted it into a similar who - cares attitude crossed with camp - is engaging , without the personal background .
the story of stuart , though , is a tougher sell because he 's the everyman , and when you ca n't totally identify with the everyman , your story 's in slight trouble .
as a cultural rock piece , "" velvet goldmine "" is rather good , but it is merely good .
it never totally takes off , although it has moments where it absolutely flies
,
but then comes back down .
it 's really nothing more than
a bunch of really great moments , surrounded by material that could really be much better .
the beginning is captivating but slow , the middle is fantastic , and the ending is not only shallow but worse than that
, it drags ( the final half hour not only does it not bring the story to any real conclusion , it could probably stop at any point ) .
and did anyone really figure out what the mystery is that arthur unearths ?
it almost seems like there was no point in the entire investigation other than to unearth the past , which is commendable but
not totally so .
still , it does what the oliver stone pic "" the doors "" did n't do right , becoming very insightful to what happened , using the visual style to hit most of the right notes of contrast between what made the era so great to those who lived during it and
why after living through such an era that everything else seems half - assed ( i suppose the message is : "" live life , but after you 've lived it , what else is the point when you 'll be forced to live with regretful memories ? "" ) .
the really superb achievement of this film is that during its flashbacks , it successfully creates for the audience what it must have felt like to be in that era , but with the added perk of knowing the result of all that goes down .",1,"['radiate with gorgeous cinematography', 'the engaging part', 'very insightful', 'the music is especially notable', 'the best sequence', 'the cast is rather impressive', 'really superb achievement', 'a bunch of really great moments', 'come off greatly', 'nicely accentuates', 'captivating', 'engaging', 'rather good', 'addictively campy', 'fantastic', 'it has moments where it absolutely flies']"
"in , "" the muse "" albert brooks plays steven phillips , a hollywood screenwriter who after winning a humanitarian award for his work is dumped by his studio .
they claim that he 's lost his edge and his agent is quick to agree with them .
he knows that he needs to write something fresh and original and quick or else his career will be over .
so he turns to his "" best "" friend , jack ( jeff bridges ) another screenwriter who 's enjoyed success after success .
on the way over to jack 's house steven sees jack helping an attractive woman ( sharon stone ) into a cab and begins to think : is he having an affair ?
when confronted , jack relunctently tells him that this mystery woman is , in fact , a muse , a mythological figure who is believed to have inspired all creativity , and has helped him garner his success .
""
she does n't do any actual writing , "" he is told , "" but inspires you .
"" steven is excited by what he 's hearing and asks jack to call her up to see if she 'll take steven on as a new client .
jack arranges a meeting between the two and suggests that steven bring her a present , preferably something from tiffany 's .
after the meeting the muse , sarah decides to take on steven , but at a price : she wants a suite at the four seasons and wants steven to perform odd tasks for her ( like bringing her salads in the middle of the night . )
steven 's wife ( andy macdowell ) sees him at a food store and questions him about why he has tampons in his wagon .
steven confesses everything and , although at first suspicious , she later allows sarah to move into their guest room and eventually into their life .
the only question for steven is if the muse is worth all the trouble he 's going through for her .
and that 's a question only time will tell .
""
the muse "" is albert brooks ' sixth film as writer / director / actor ( he co - wrote with monica johnson ) and although it 's a good movie
it 's not up to the level of his best works ( "" defending your life "" and "" mother "" ) .
the problem lies in the script , and for a movie that relies on its dialogue for its humor , there are n't nearly as many laughs as they are chuckles despite a few good one - liners .
it has a great premise but does n't deliver up to it 's full potential .

"in the past , tim burton has taken cinema by storm with the action packed batman , and the hilarious ed wood , but lately his films just do n't cut it .
sleepy hollow has some unique features , but the script is a terrible mess
.
for those who remember disney 's fantastic "" adventures of ichabod crane "" , it is actually superior to this .
disney 's version was at least interesting , while burton 's film drags on far too long , without any suspense or frights .
while the stories are similar , the new version adds too much to the once likable story , and throws in some weak dialogue to top it off .
ichabod crane ( johnny depp ) is now apparently a constable , who was sent to new york to investigate suspicious murders .
the victims are headless , and no traces of evidence were found , until the murderer reveals himself , hence the headless horseman .
now with the help of christina ricci and an orphaned boy , they must stop the headless horseman from a killing spree , that could destroy the whole town of sleepy hollow .
sure the headless horseman is an intriguing character , but the story has so many holes that even he nor depp can save this disaster
.
in the original , the headless horseman was meant to be unstoppable .
no one could stop him , not even ichabod .
by the end of the film , it had audiences in deep thought .
burton however concentrates far too much on the atmosphere , and how to make the main characters heroes .
he takes no risk what so ever , and this is where he fails .
another pathetic element of the film was the script .
like i said earlier , he just stuffed too much in at one time , and made it look real sloppy , kind of like the mess
the headless horseman made with his victims .
he completely butchered the story to pieces .
thankfully there are a few factors that i particularly liked .
the acting by depp was quite notable .
he took the nerdy character of the cartoon , and simply acted it out in a better manner .
if it was n't for his quirky one - liners , i doubt i could have remained awake , because quite frankly i was getting sleepy
.
just when i thought christina ricci was getting to be a good actress , she winds up doing this .
it just goes to show no actress or actor can pass up a big blockbuster .
it 's too tempting to let go , even if the script is mush .
the atmosphere too was quite involving .
i should have just gazed at the sets , and the eerie fog , rather than actually pay attention to what was going on .
at least burton 's films are eye candy , even if they are trash .
the only real scenes of value were the tree full of heads , and the fight between the horseman , depp and casper van dien .
other than that ,
i wish i could just fast forward through all the gaping holes in the film , and just sit back and stare at the scenery .
by the end , i can only think back and laugh at how bad sleepy hollow developed .
this is the biggest disappointment of the year , especially when such a talented director like burton handles a project like this .
do n't waste your time or money , because your head will feel hollow .",0,"[""do n't waste your time or money , because your head will feel hollow"", 'takes no risk what so ever , and this is where he fails . another pathetic element of the film was the script . like i said earlier , he just stuffed too much in at one time , and made it look real sloppy , kind of like the mess', 'story has so many holes that even he nor depp can save this disaster', 'the script is a terrible mess', 'throws in some weak dialogue', 'drags on far too long , without any suspense or frights', 'quite frankly i was getting sleepy', 'concentrates far too much', 'i can only think back and laugh at how bad sleepy hollow developed . this is the biggest disappointment of the year', 'the script is mush', 'they are trash', 'i wish i could just fast forward through all the gaping holes in the film', 'completely butchered the story to pieces']"
"carry on matron is the last great carry - on film in my opinion .
made in 1972 , it still features most of the regulars of this genre .
sid james plays the head of a gang of crooks intent on stealing contraceptive pills from the local maternity hospital and selling them off to make a profit , kenneth williams is sir bernard cutting , head of the hospital but also a hypochondriac , hattie jacques re - takes her role as matron , and charles hawtrey is the psychiatrist dr .
goode .
the jokes come in fast and so do the laughs , with humorous antics between the matron and sir bernard .
this time , williams is after matron ( jacques ) when he needs to prove himself that he is a man after visiting dr .
goode .
the doctor ( hawtrey ) is sworn to secrecy : - "" i assure you , that anything you say to me today will go in one ear and straight out of the other !
"" bernard thinks he is having a sex change and needs to prove himself .
there are great cameos from joan sims , an expectant mother who is many weeks overdue and is eating constantly in every scene , and from kenneth connor as the expectant father who still thinks he 's at work ( at the railway station ) .
sid james ' gang including cyril his son ( kenneth cope ) try to find out where the pills are by getting cyril to dress up as a nurse and live in at the nurses home .
he has to share a room with nurse ball ( barbara windsor ) and she soon sees through him !
the film ends with the attempted robbery of the hospital 's pills with panic ensuing .
there are good performances by hattie jacques as the matron , however her character seems a little more subdued and quieter than her previous ' matron 's ' .
williams is , as usual , on top form , but sid james is n't given a very good part in this movie and i would forgive anyone to forget that he was in the movie at all .
the same does not go for charles hawtrey , for although he only first appears in the movie after 30 minutes gone and has scarce screen time ,
he seems to steal every scene he is in . by not making use of sid james and barbara windsor 's talent to full effect , the film seems to flounder , but it certainly makes up for it with it 's good storyline
and it 's other appealing characters .
this film is genuinely funny and i could watch it again and again and not get bored !",1,"['good storyline', 'great cameos', 'good performances', 'other appealing characters', 'i could watch it again and again and not get bored', 'on top form', 'this film is genuinely funny', 'last great carry - on film', 'the jokes come in fast and so do the laughs', 'humorous antics', 'he seems to steal every scene he is in']"
"everything about this ninth trek movie seems on the cheap , from the roger corman - grade special effects to its highly derivative and ugly ad campaign
( the poster is nearly identical to that of star trek
vi : the undiscovered country ) .
but piller 's not - quite - half - baked screenplay should ultimately claim responsibility for insurrection 's failure .
i 'm about to give the same advice to rick berman and co .
as i 've given to the financiers of james bond movies : it 's time to breathe life into this workhorse by hiring solid genre writers and a real director .
( while we 're at it , put that visor back on laforge ! )
for three hundred years , the ba'ku species ( who look just like humans ) have lived on a ringed - planet that might as well be called the fountain of youth .
six hundred of them occupy the briar patch , the area affected by metaphasic radition , a positive energy that reverses the aging process in the elderly .
but evil ru'afo ( this is probably abraham 's last stop before performing "" amadeus "" at a dinner theatre near you ) , leader of the son'a ( who look just like burn victims after reconstructive surgery ) , wants to relocate the ba'ku and movie his people onto the briar patch in their place , in order to replenish his dying breed .
the federation is all for this , but picard feels this is a direct violation of the prime directive : to not interfere with the development of an alien race .
( never mind that the ba'ku did n't exactly evolve - they went wandering in the universe one day and stumbled upon the magic world . )
every time frakes gives an interview lately , he seems to top whatever ludicrous statement he last gave regarding this installment .
he has called it a comedy , a thinking man 's picture , a throwback to the old series , and , most grievously , he has likened it to a john ford western .
( i presume that 's some john ford
he went to school with , not the director of the searchers . )
he has also gone on record as saying paramount recut the film from his version .
that 's no excuse -
someone generated this footage .
muddy cinematography and sitcom sets are the least of its problems ; star trek : insurrection appears to have been beamed in from the planet plotholia . consider such curiosities . . .
picard 's love interest , anij ( donna murphy ) , can slow things down by staring at them ( such as a waterfall or falling rocks ) -her scientific explanation for this ?
"" do n't ask .
""
worf gets a pimple ( he 's re - experiencing klingon puberty thanks to the time - defying atmosphere ) , laforge regains his eyesight ( trust me , levar burton 's real eyes are scarier than those electronic lenses he wore in first contact ) and troi brags about her firm boobs , but picard remains as bald as an android 's butt .
most suspiciously , what exactly is the problem with letting this endangered race have a little fun in the sun ?
the filmmakers cloud the issue with some nonsense about a family feud of sorts , and they also turn ru'afo into a completely power - mad superfreak , just so the characters will have something to do in the climax .
( and if you 've seen return of the jedi , you 've seen the ending of this movie . ) did n't picard himself previously disobey the prime directive when he prevented the borg from assimilating millions ?
frakes lucked out with first contact , and repeat viewings of that film reveal the seeds of what went wrong in his direction of insurrection :
he has no sense of comic timing , and he mines for acting chemistry where none exists .
( take a look at the painful "" troi gets drunk "" scene in fc and you 'll get the general idea of insurrection 's unsuccessfully jokey and hollow tone . )
even the worst shatner and co .
treks , like the final frontier , maintained a watchability thanks to the effortless ,
charming comaraderie between kirk , spock , and bones .
neither first contact nor insurrection has any idea what to do with crusher ( gates mcfadden , whom i must say maintains a fabulous physique ) , troi , or laforge .
and all three next generation films spend too much time on data , who is the franchise 's answer to urkel .
need a cheap laugh ?
have data say something sexual , or start singing , or lift up a four hundred pound boulder as if it 's the hunk of styrofoam it really is .
here 's my proposed title for number 10 : data star data trek : data data data data data .
in this movie , data will become preoccupied with learning to blow his nose , while crusher and troi watch silently from 500 yards away and laforge points his sinister gaze at the android in doubly robotic observation .
star trek : insurrection had one nice , eerie , silent moment that hints at a better , darker film .

"screen story by kevin yagher and andrew kevin
walker .
screenplay by andrew kevin walker .
inspired by the short story the legend of sleepy hollow by washington irving .
directed by tim burton .
starring johnny depp , christina ricci , and casper van dien .
special appearances by christopher lee and christopher walken .
synopsis : investigator ichabod crane journeys to
1799 sleepy hollow to investigate a series of murders involving decapitation .
townspeople believe the spirit of a dead german mercenary is threatening them .
cute blonde katrina and a listless orphan help crane solve the mystery .
comments : tim burton has directed a number of entertaining and groundbreaking films over the years .
batman , of course , is perhaps his best - known film and led to a string of less successful sequels .
he 's done biographical work ( on the director ed wood ) , children 's movies ( nightmare before christmas ) , and a homage to alien invasion movies ( mars attacks ! ) .
sleepy hollow , his newest feature which fans have been anticipating for a while , shares the similar dark and atmospheric style of his earlier work and counts among his better movies .
sleepy hollow quite obviously draws its inspiration from the old period horror films of the 1950s and 1960s , especially hammer studios ' reworkings of dracula and frankenstein , and american international 's series of movies based on the works of edgar allan poe .
christopher lee , in fact , star of many hammer productions over the years , appears at the beginning of sleepy hollow as a judge who sends ichabod crane out to investigate the murders .
the movie also borrows from the universal monster movies of the 1930s .
one of the climatic scenes involves a windmill and obviously takes its cue from frankenstein .
i mention these allusions for a reason .
seasoned horror film fans , including myself , will smile at their inclusion in this film .
with the recent disappointments in theatrically released horror movies , especially the blair witch project ( the most overblown turkey of the decade ) , we needed a film like this .
not only does it have a sense of history , but burton 's skillful use of setting and mood make this an entertaining exercise in horror .
the film 's eerie landscapes and foggy towns , indeed , overshadow the actors and the plot as the most noteworthy aspect of the movie .
johnny depp , a veteran tim burton actor who has appeared both in ed wood and edward scissorhands , plays ichabod crane , who has apparently changed occupations from irving 's original story and is now an investigator .
depp is adequate in his role .
no more ; no less .
equally adequate is christina ricci , who plays the love interest in the film .
she 's a good witch too .
how cute .
one of the few weak parts of sleepy hollow is the wooden and cliched dialogue between the main characters .
the two actors , however , carry the movie well enough , but the supporting cast is what makes this movie shine .
veteran actors such as jeffrey jones and michael gough ( who played the butler alfred in all four recent batman flicks ) are terrific
as the aging townsfolk involved in the conspiracy which depp uncovers . while i do not wish to reveal crucial plot points , i can say that the storyline becomes quite confusing .
you have to pay attention .
andrew kevin walker wrote the screenplay .
he 's the one who also wrote 8 mm and seven .
walker is quickly becoming one of the premiere suspense writers in hollywood , and sleepy hollow
certainly does n't hurt his growing reputation .
as one might imagine from a gentleman like walker , sleepy hollow is quite graphic .
there 's a lot of blood and a lot of beheadings .
this is definately not a flick to take the young kids to .
a lady in front of us took her two young sons to see it and spent about 25 - 30 minutes covering the youngest 's eyes with her hand .
he was obviously upset by the movie 's intense violence .
if you 're looking for a good scare , however , sleepy hollow is definately recommended .",1,"['the supporting cast is what makes this movie shine', 'equally adequate', 'entertaining exercise in horror', 'we needed a film like this', ""certainly does n't hurt his growing reputation"", 'is definately recommended', 'adequate in his role', 'counts among his better movies', 'carry the movie well enough', 'skillful use', 'terrific']"
"susan granger 's review of "" two can play that game "" ( screen gems ) since the success of "" waiting to exhale , "" there have been several romantic comedies about african - american professionals .

unfortunately , writer / director mark brown ( "" how to be a player "" ) breaks the cardinal rule of romantic comedy : you have to like the protagonist - and shrill , self - congratulatory

"andrew lloyd webber 's musicals , preferably his early work with lyricist tim rice , present a musical which is totally unlike any musical before its time .
webber and rice do not subscribe to the gaity of such musicals as "" oklahoma ! , "" or the slapstickness of shows like "" a funny thing happened on the way to the forum .
""
they instead tackle hot issues from our past , and view them differently , and pack them together with redundant , catchy music , as well as thoughtful lyrics .
like "" jesus christ superstar , "" which examined the rise and fall of jesus in his last days from a fame perspective ( in the cool tune "" superstar , "" a dead judas comes back from the dead to ask jesus why he did n't spread his message wider ) , "" evita "" takes an inventive stance on its topic , this time being the famed wife of argentinian dictator , juan per ?
n ,
eva , who slept her way to the top and became famous chiefly because she got attention , much like the woman playing her : madonna ( although i think madonna did rise to the top for her musical talent , among other things ) .
"" evita "" deals with the rise and fall of eva per ?
n , a woman who captured the heart of the nation after marrying juan ( jonathan pryce ) , then died at the young age of 33 , creating an international stir of mourning not unlike that of princess di ( the two do share a bit in common , although it was n't like di slept to "" the top "" ) .
webber and rice sure chose bizarre topics for their musicals , but they always have a point for doing it .
here , they wish to expose her for what she is , but still show that despite all of her many drawbacks , her lying , and covering up for her fascist husband , but show that she was still a good woman with fairly good intentions , and her death was very sad .
it 's also a musical , with almost no words not unsung .
the film plays like a rock opera , much like their "" jesus christ superstar , "" with many giant musical sequences just like the old musicals , even if they do possess very intelligent lyrics , which create not only an intellectually enlightening experience , but also a very entertaining one . after all , this is a musical , and webber 's musicals never undermine this .
they are a balance of energy and intellectual depth , walking on a fine line between the both , and never stumbling on either side .
this is why the beginning of "" evita "" is kind of a let - down .
okay , it is a let - down .
i 'm not saying the opening moments are bad , because they 're pretty good .
but what comes after is a lifeless , un - entertaining , and totally unrewarding sequence where she cons a singer ( jimmy nail ) into taking eva to buenos aires after a one - night stand .
in the musical , it 's a fun , energetic sequence , culiminating in the show stopper , "" buenos aires , "" which is also lifeless .
then a punch is pulled as we see eva being screwed over by the singer , instead of her leaving him , where she ends up singing the sad tune , "" another suitcase in another hall , "" which was meant for a later character , screwed over by eva .
the portrayal of eva in the beginning is too soft , seeming like parker and oliver stone , who adapted it for the screen , are afraid to present her for what she is , even while it 's being narrated by a hater of eva 's , the omnipotent ( antonio banderas ) , who presents her in a negative light .
for a while , it looks like alan parker ca n't pull it off . however , the film pulls itself together in a flash , and after that song is over , and the giddily nihilistic song "" goodbye and thank you , "" where we see eva go through a long line of lovers who help her ascend , is magnificent , darkly comical , and just gleeful .
from this point on , the film is hypnotic , satisfying , and satirical .
no more punches are thrown , and the basic outline of the original musical are in tact .
we see eva woo and marry juan , get him out of jail , rise to stardom , falter a bit , come back , and then gradually die of cancer ( i think it was because of cancer ) .
more importantly , many of the themes from the musical carry on with this , as well as some filling - in - the - gaps reconnassaince work .
juan , who is pretty underwritten in the musical , is given some extra scenes , and exposed as what he was for eva : an accessory .
a muted scene where he tries to visit her respective room but is shunned allows us to learn more about juan , and understand his sadness more than we did before .
> from the "" goodbye and thank you "" number on
, the film shows eva trying to cover up for the horrible government by doing cheap and petty things which wooed a nation , and saved a government , even while it left the nation 's people downtrodden .
but despite this , the nation still loved eva , and when she slipped into death , the world mourned her because she was a star .
that 's when our narrator , ch ? , comes out to show that she was n't the great woman she really was , and expose her fame .
describing this character is difficult , mainly because he has no real realistic background ( he 's said to be based on the revolutionary ch ?
guevera , but the two probably could have never met , like they do in the film ) , but he serves as a perspective on eva , but even his perspective ca n't help us from feeling bad when eva dies a pathetic death .
alan parker , no stranger to bizarre musicals ( he 's done "" fame , "" "" the committments , "" "" bugsy malone , "" and "" pink floyd the wall "" - the latter which is absolutely brilliant ) , nails the film , exposing everything for what it is .
we cry for evita at the end because we feel we should , by the way it is presented .
his direction is manipulative for a reason : to show the mourning for what it is .
and there is energy throughout ,
with lots of bright colors , and scenes which are cinematically entertaning , as well as enriching and deep , such as the balcony scene where she sings "" do n't cry for me , argentina , "" and her death sequence , which is poignant becuase of how sad it is .
madonna 's golden globe winning performance is much like the movie : starts kinda downhill then goes up quickly , remaning there for the rest of the film .
at the beginning , she looks like she 's too busy concentrating on her singing to act , but she eventually gets it right , though never really getting the presence of , say , patti lupone ( who did the role in its american premiere back in the late 70s ) .
her death , though , is brilliant .
her singing could be better though .
i know she took lessons to improve her range and all , but it still sounds like she 's trying to hard .
she sounds way too soft in several places where she should be comanding ( like . . .
patti lupone - i heard her sing on an old "" evita "" cd , and you could just feel her stage presence without even seeing her ) .
but it 's generally very good , although not up to the brilliance the role really requires .
antonio banderas , who is almost like a guilty pleasure these days ( i 'm one of the few people who thinks he rocks ) , is
extremely comanding in his performance , presenting a lovable narrator .
his singing is very good , though nothing compared to the original , mandy patinkin .
he does have a pretty good singing voice , and a great range . and jonathan pryce is pretty awesome , although very brief at times , in his role as juan , seeming to put on a poker face for his melancholy facade .
although it gets off to a rocky start ( "" rocky "" 's polite for what it really is ) , it soon picks up and becomes a wonderully poignant musical .
like the other musical released in ' 96 ( woody allen 's

"if he does n't watch out , mel gibson is in danger of being known as someone other than mad max .
of course there are still a few big guns in this film , but there 's some accomplished acting too .
although gibson continues to shed his rough and gritty anti - hero skin as his career progresses , here he explores a new genre : the businessman as action hero .
in ron howard 's latest film , gibson plays tom mullen , a gazillionaire airline owner whose son is snatched from the junior science fair by kidnappers .
mullen at first agrees to pay the ransom , but when things fall apart he rethinks the situation .
a veteran of numerous hard - nosed business negotiations , the tycoon realizes that in order to get his son back alive , he has to play his hand differently .
the casting is what puts this film over the top .
the trio of gibson , the kidnappers ' mastermind ( gary sinise ) and fbi team leader ( delroy lindo ) play off of each other wonderfully .
sinise is perfect as the driven scheming sleezebag is right on the mark .
his speech to mullen over a walkie talkie about h .
g .

mullen and the other glitteratti frolic up on high while sinise and the other lowlifes
dwell below , feeding off the unsuspecting .
gibson 's character is an all - american hero with a few flaws .
his cowboy tactics tend to work , but they are also what got him into this situation to begin with .
in a round about way , if he were n't known as a man who is willing to buy his way out of trouble , his son would n't have been kidnapped .
as sinise says "" you 're a payer .
you did it once
and now you 're going to do it again .
"" one of the nicest elements of this film is that most of the characters actually have personalities .
lindo calls home to talk to his kids , obviously shaken at working this case .
even the kidnappers are real people , arguing about the ultimate fate of sean mullen and feeding him candy bars .
gibson 's break - down on the balcony of their penthouse apartment is especially effective .
it 's one of the best filmed representations of a man 's world falling apart that i 've seen
.
it 's not all perfect .
the shoot 'em upending , while emotionally satisfying seems tacked on to be just that rather than to provide a powerful resolution .
as well crafted as the scene is , we 've seen it before .
mullen 's wife ( rene russo ) has several good moments , but occasionally just seems to be there .
while adequate , brawley nolte ( sean ) does n't provide much to the film other than occupying space to build the story around .
but you 'll ignore these problems as each minute of the movie builds on the previous one .

"" starring lee kang - sheng , yang kuei - mei directed by tsai ming - liang written by tsai and yang ping - ying cinematography by liao peng - jung taiwan , 24/12/99 .
the millenium approaches .
an incessant downpour batters an unnamed city .
sectors of the city are being sealed , quarantined due to the onset of a mysterious virus .
the virus causes people to act like insects : they crawl about on all fours , hide from bright lights , huddle in damp corners .
the water supply to the quarantined zones will be cut off in a week 's time .
residents are advised to evacuate the area , asap .
this premise -- kafka by way of cronenberg -- is the background for the hole , which could have been a great movie , but , sadly , ends up as a waste of good ideas .
the quick sketch above suggests a dark , absurd , hallucinatory near - future parable of life in the late 20th century ; in execution , however , it is nothing like that .
the virus , the evacuation , the visual possiblities of the deluge : these are all relegated to the background .
instead , the hole focuses on the lives -- for want of a better word -- of a man ( lee kang - sheng ) and a woman ( yang kuei - mei ) who live in the same apartment building , and who have no personalities .
the entire movie taks place in settings that are uniformly ugly and sterile : the charmless rooms and corridors of a post - industrial apartment complex , photographed to look as dim and dingy as possible .
it 's a vivid setting , but an unappealing
one , especially with the monotonous hiss of falling rain and the gurgle of drainage pipes in the background .
the man lives in the apartment directly above the woman 's .
one day , a repairman investigating a leak leaves a small hole in the floor of the man 's living room , opening into the ceiling of the woman 's living room .
this hole -- symbol of the solitary opening in the character 's lonely , compartmented lives -- allows them to interact in unusual ( and mostly non - verbal ) ways .
example : the man , suffering from the onset of the virus (
or so i assume -- everything is obscure in this movie ) vomits through the hole .
the woman , wandering around in the dark , accidentally puts her hand on his vomit , and then cleans it up .
this is what passes for meaningful communication .
and they say romance is dead .
much of the film does not even focus on their interactions , such as they are .
there is almost no dialogue and we learn next to nothing about these people .
they are ciphers .
instead , we are treated to long takes in which we witness their miserable lives ; we watch , for instance , as the woman boils some water , pours it onto some noodles , then eats the noodles .
( this is as fascinating as it sounds . )
offered as counterpoint -- or perhaps relief -- to these dreary sequences are a series of musical numbers , fantasies in which the woman lip - synchs to pop songs by grace chan ( popular , so
i 'm told , in 1950s ' china ) .
she prances around in grimy hallways and grungy stairwells , incronguously lit by cheerfully bright spotlights .
sometimes , in these fantasies , she is joined by the man .
these scenes are presumably intended to be bright and fanciful , sharply contrasting the dreariness of reality , but they fail .
when the man and the woman dance , it seems half - hearted and listless .
astaire and rogers
this is not .
even in imagination , these people are numb , weary , boring .
the hole is part of the ' collection 2000 ' series , a group of films commissioned by french tv station la sept arte on the subject of the millenium .
others include canada 's last night , brazil 's midnight , and american hal hartley 's the book of life .
the book of life is the only other one that i have seen , and it is infinitely superior to the taiwanese entry .
witty , energetic , humane , it makes the the hole seem ( ahem ) empty .
american movies with nothing to say try to disguise their lack of content with flashy movements , quick cuts , superficial emotions .
foreign movies with nothing to say do what the hole does : they point the camera at something of minimal interest for unbelievably long periods of time , and call it art .
the hole is self - evidently a film about alienation , and perhaps director tsai ming - liang wants the audience to share in his characters ' alienation .
if so , he succeeds .
perhaps it is a challenge : he dares us to enjoy this movie , despite his best attempts to ensure that we do n't .
if it was a challenge , i was n't up for it .",0,"['numb , weary , boring', 'they fail', 'there is almost no dialogue and we learn next to nothing about these people', 'unappealing', 'ends up as a waste of good ideas', 'point the camera at something of minimal interest for unbelievably long periods of time']"
"the above is dialogue from this film , taken almost completely in context , and not jazzed up a bit to make it more inept than it is .
it is spoken between two of the protagonists somewhere in the film , and basically serves as a perfect example of what this film is about , especially if you realize that this exchange is meant to be taken seriously .
mr .
gregg "" i'm - having - a - mid - life - crisis
"" araki , the writer and director of this film , wants to show how important teenagers are , and wants to show how they feel in such a horrible , horrible world .
and how does he show it ?
by really cheap surrealism , and moronic exchanges like this .
oh , and it gets better .
a similar bit of dialogue is said in the middle of ,
oh i dunno , the fiftieth sex scene in this film ( i 'm not counting the several masturbation scenes ) .
in it , one of the protagonists is humping away on top of another , and he says to her something along the lines of
"" do you ever wonder what life is all about ?
""
sorry , man : foreplay takes place before the act of coitus .
of course , what do you expect : the film was written and directed by a guy who ca n't even spell his first name right
( yes , i know it 's a cheap joke , but it had to be done ) .
""
the doom generation "" is advertised as a road trip movie about people who go around killing others who attack them , and also as another "" teen angst "" film ( one of the slogans is "" teen is a four - letter word "" - hardy har har ) .
it 's a film
about two angsty teens - amy blue ( rose macgowan , who would later play the buxom tatum in "" scream "" ) and jordon white ( james duval , who would go on to play randy quaid 's son in "" independence day "" ) - who pick up an angsty homicidal maniac , xavier red ( jonathan schaech , who would go on to play the angsty lead guitarist in "" that thing you do ! "" - and by the way , do you get the symbolism ?
red , white , and blue ?
huh ?
huh ? ) , and go on a road trip where three things happen , in no order : 1 ) they have sex ;
2 ) they run into weird people ; 3 ) they kill them .
the film is basically a remix of a bunch of other far superior films .
gregg araki obviously has seen such films as "" easy rider , "" "" natural born killers , "" and "" kalifornia , "" and tries to borrow elements from all these films and make something which is like a pop culture reference guide .
but what he forgets is these films either represented something that this film does not , or that they dug deep into their subjects and brought something out of them to make them deeper .
""
the doom generation "" does n't want to do this ; it just wants to show everything in a surreal manner for the sole reason that araki does not want to deal with them on any kind of real level .
he wants to show everything in a weird manner , and forgets what the scenes are supposed to be about .
here 's one scene , an earlier scene in the film : amy and jordan go into a quick - e mart type place to get food and other stuff .
amy is smoking , and the clerk , an asian man mind you ( i love how racist this film is , i really do ) , tells her to put it out .
she tells him to fuck off or something to that note .
he points a shotgun at her , and she puts it out reluctantly .
jordan makes two hot dogs , and takes them to the counter .
the cash register rings up "" 6 . 66
"" ( oh , and this symbolism does n't stop here ) .
jordan checks for his wallet
but it 's really in the car .
he asks amy for it , but she left her wallet in the car as well .
the clerk brings out his shotgun again and asks for the money .
they say they do n't have it .
he gets ready to kill them , but then xavier , who they ditched in the middle of nowhere a scene before , pops out of nowhere , fights with the clerk , and ends with him blowing the clerk 's head clean off ( clean wound , mind you ) .
the head is shown flying through the air , and lands in a fryer , where it begins to scream .
i do n't really object to this kind of sick violence , but this scene is in the film for one reason and one reason only : to gross you out .
araki thinks that if he takes everything to the extreme , he 'll make some kind of art . wrong .
it takes a kind of resistance to make gore art .
when george romero made "" dawn of the dead , "" a very gory flick even for today , he had control over everything and still was able to make everything sick .
same goes for peter jackson 's disgustingly gory "" dead alive , "" which features a 30 minute long fest of blood , guts , dismemberments , flesh chewing , and other assorted stuff , all ending with a guy with a lawn mower strapped to his body , taking out all sorts of zombies .
it was sick , but it was also satirical , and controled .
a scene like this has no purpose in the film , and it sticks out from everything else that happens .
here 's a couple other scenes : jordan and amy have sex in a bath tub and xavier watches , masturbates , and then licks the semen from his hand ;
xavier and amy have sex and jordan watches from the window , masturbates , and falls backwards ; a man attacks the trio , and is stabbed in the crotch by a giant sword ( put there just so this could happen ) ; a fast food employee stalks the trio , and his arm is shot off by xavier ; and various other annoyances .
also , look for about a million camoes from a wide assortment of people , who probably did n't really know what they were getting into when they signed up to do it ( just like peter o'toole , helen mirren , malcolm macdowell , and john gielgud probably did n't when they signed to be in "" caligula "" ) .
people such as indie actors parker posey and nicky katt , alternative rock stars skinny puppy and perry farrel , hollywood madam heidi fleiss , christopher "" peter brady "" mcknight , amanda bearse , and margaret cho all grace the screen for a matter of seconds , then disappear so that we can return to the annoying main plot line .
why are they here ?
so that we can all point to them and say "" hey
, look it 's ( fill in the blank ) !
wow !
"" gimme a break .
the film 's meaning is pretty easy to detect : that , you know , teens are so precious , and the world is such a horrible place , that when the two entities collide , there 's a giant explosion of horrific violence .
otherwise defined as "" teen angst , "" or the belief that being a teenager is a horrible thing and that the world is too bad for you .
look , i 'm 19 years old .
i went through a very brief teen angst thing which curiously lasted about as long as my taste in nirvana did .
i 've since moved on to "" i do n't really know what to do with my life "" phase , but the teen angst phase is something which is so annoyingly sophomoric and ignorant that any film that thinks they 're dealing with it on any kind of serious level is just beating the wrong horse .
part of being a teen is experimenting , and testing the waters .
it 's not whining about how awful parents are , and purposely feeling dispondent .
this is what the characters in this film do , and the film wants to show how they 're these great people who are being punished by the world because they 're teenagers , and how they try to defend themselves but ca n't totally overcome them .
it 's not their fault they kill people ; it 's the world 's !
what they really need is a reality check .
the world is a bad place , and teenagers can be easily harmed because they are experimenting .
but part of it is taking everything that happens to you and learning from it .
the film thinks that teenagers are basically doomed , and there 's nothing they can do about it .
hence the title .
not only does it have bad fallacy , but it ca n't even express this in an intelligent and coherent manner .
everything 's overly surreal , and all we get are scenes of graphic violence and graphic sex .
how does xavier licking semen off his hand express teen angst ?
how does a talking decapitated head show that teens are dispondent because the world makes them this way ?
and why does the film constantly go back to the teen angst issue of the film ?
if araki had any kind of competence in writing or direction , he 'd show them for what they really are .
and if he did n't want the satirical approach , he 'd show the real problems with the world .
and if you still do n't think that "" the doom generation "" is incompetent on every single possible level it could be , take the acting .
rose macgowan is horrible .
yes , she proved herself talented in "" scream , "" but she 's so bad in "" the doom generation "" that if i had not seen her in "" scream , "" i would have christened her one of the worst actresses working in films today .
her entire performance is one - note
( bitchy ) , and the one scene where she cries over a dead animal is so forced that it 's laughable .
equally bad is jonathan schaech , who wants to be the slacker serial killer : someone who does n't have any remorse because emotions cause some kind of strain .
his performance is annoying as hell , and granted , he was better in "" that thing you do !
""
and then there 's james duval .
let 's just say he makes keanu reeves look like brando .
he has the same kind of slacker stuttering , only much much much worse , and every line he says is so bad that i have now deemed him "" least talented actor in the world .
"" i have seen lots of bad actors , but james duval has got to be the worst .
or at least somewhere up there .
here 's another example of a bad scene , if you 're still not convinced : the film opens up in a club where they 're playing nine inch nail 's most banal song , "" heresy "" ( example of the lines :
"" god is dead / and no one cares / if there is a hell / i'll see you there "" ) , and as the song plays , and red strobe lights show the patrons dancing , the film pans over to amy , just standing there , looking dispondent .
the film closes in on her , she looks right at the camera and says "" fuck .
""
no explanation of this should be necessary .
and finally , a note to gregg : grow up .
really .
move out of your parent 's basement , read something other than salinger , and get a day job .
and do n't quit it .",0,"['i would have christened her one of the worst actresses working in films today . her entire performance is one - note', 'a scene like this has no purpose in the film , and it sticks out from everything else that happens', 'horrible', ""not only does it have bad fallacy , but it ca n't even express this in an intelligent and coherent manner"", 'hardy har har', 'if araki had any kind of competence', ""so forced that it 's laughable"", 'his performance is annoying as hell', 'various other annoyances', 'has got to be the worst', 'he has the same kind of slacker stuttering , only much much much worse , and every line he says is so bad that i have now deemed him "" least talented actor in the world .

"on april 12th , 1912 , the most astonishing shipwreck in the history of the world occurred .
on that fateful night , the titanic sunk .
now , more than 50 years later , a film has been made . and what a film that is .
james cameron 's newest movie is a landmark in storytelling , emotion , and special effects .
it starts in the present , where bill paxton and his band of scientists explore the depths of the ship 's wreckage .
exploring an old chest , paxton comes across a nude drawing of a young woman .
the drawing is televised and the woman ( gloria stuart ) whose portrait the painting is of comes forward and slowly but surely , the ship 's story is told .
leonardo dicaprio stars as jack dawson , a young man with a sketch book , a heart of gold , an intelligent mind , and not much else .
he wins his ticket aboard titanic in a poker game , and is the perfect match for rose dewitt bukater ( kate winslett ) .
she grows to love jack , but seems unable to escape the slimy clutches of her arranged fiance ' , cal hockley ( billy zane ) .
the film takes its time , and by doing so , makes us care about its characters , and shows us the full aspects of human emotion .

"remember back in the mid 1990s when crime and macabre movies were all the rage ? "" pulp fiction "" and "" fargo "" both managed to get oscar nominations for the best picture , and not surprisingly , a slew of rip - offs followed in the years thereafter .
that fad seems to be over but here comes christopher mcquarrie writing and directing "" the way of the gun
"" that at first glance looks like another of those wanna -
be 's but upon closer inspection does n't look like anything comprehendable .
it 's a crime story
so wrapped up in its own little world
it has a claustrophobic atmosphere - a film that wo n't allow the story much room to expand outside its handful of characters and somehow still manages to turn a simple premise into something so complex its ridiculous .
complexity should come as no surprise to anyone who 's familiar with mcquarrie , he wrote "" the usual suspects , "" which has become a cult favorite despite little critical acclaim .
that film had a great story and was well directed but had such an elaborate , confusing screenplay it leaves many viewers scratching their heads after repeated viewings .
you have to wonder if mcquarrie really had everything mapped out or if he was going for the hollywood idea that "" if it 's really confusing and about criminals and cops that makes it fascinating .
"" with "" the way of the gun "" mcquarrie seems to be capitalizing on the same idea , but this time the story is far less commercial - a shame because maybe that would have helped .
the film tells the story of two drifters with no ambition and barely a reason to live but are n't hell - bent on death either ( played by ryan phillipie and benecio del toro ) .
they get lucky when they hear about a scheme between a big - shot exec guy and his trophy wife who are going to have a baby through in vitro fertilization .
they figure they can kidnap the surrogate mother ( played by juliette lewis ) and get a nice ransom .
along the way we continually learn of the shady dealings between the exec , his wife , their hired goons and the "" bag man "" ( played by james caan - the only actor in the film who looks like he knows what he 's doing ) .
the exec is some kind of money launderer so he obviously ca n't call the authorities for help .
his goons and the bag man are on the kidnappers ' trail and each make different offers to get the mother back .
the exec 's son is a doctor who also gets pulled into the fray and wants to make sure his patient is all right .
meanwhile each of these characters has something hidden up their collective sleeves and the double - crosses , secret love affairs and torrid pasts come as no surprise even though little of it has any relevance at all .
mcquarrie does n't know the meaning of the word simple .
he seems to be more interested in showing us how clever he is than making a good movie .
everything has to be complicated and confusing , so much so that it 's to the point of surrealism .
nothing is what it seems in this reality , it 's one of those movies where you get dropped right into the middle of the criminal world and are expected to know most of the industry 's rules and regulations .
every scene with caan 's character exemplifies this perfectly - the kidnappers already know who he is and even chat with him , getting into conversations about "" the business "" and how it works and we 're hardly given a clue as to what they 're talking about .
these characters are probably supposed to be great criminal sketches but
they 're more like ideas ripped - off from sketches found in david mamet 's trash .
no one here really acts like a real person , and the story is even further removed from reality .
it 's like a dream without any appeal .
take the opening scene for example ; the phillipe and del toro characters are in a parking lot across the street from a bar or a club counting their money and stuff .
they sit on a brand - new mercedes and the car alarm goes off , the owner is waiting in line and yells at them to get away from his car
but they do n't move .
the guy and his loud - mouth , potty - mouth girlfriend and about 20 other people cross the street and gang up on them .
you 'd think phillipe ?
and del toro are ? going to pull out guns and scare them away
but they do n't , instead phillipe throws one punch and the two get beat down by a mob .
there 's a lot of things i did n't understand about this scene : first of all the owner of the mercedes is n't some yuppie or old rich snob , he 's like a hippie straight out of the 60s .
secondly , the two main characters seem to believe that they can actually take on the mob unarmed . lastly ,
it serves no purpose in the long run because later in the film the two are packing more artillery than a small country 's army . if they were suicidal they would n't have gone on the kidnapping job in the first place ( and where they get all those guns is never explained either ) .
there 's a lot more i could pick apart about this film but that would be an exercise in futility .
what it all comes down to is that nothing here is what it seems - which would be great if this movie were about pretty much any other story than what it is .
absolutely none of the characters are likable or believable .
and it 's all coated with a thin layer of black comedy which is good for a chuckle here and there
but this film is definitely not a flat - out black comedy and its use of such seems like a desperate attempt to kill screen time .
with any film you see , whether you like it or not , you can at least understand what the appeal was to it , why someone would want to make it and why someone would want to see it .
i ca n't say either for "" the way of the gun , "" because it has very little going for it and
i ca n't imagine anyone intelligently defending it .",0,"[""there 's a lot of things i did n't understand"", 'so wrapped up in its own little world', 'the story is even further removed from reality', 'absolutely none of the characters are likable or believable', 'it serves no purpose', 'it has very little going for it', ""i ca n't imagine anyone intelligently defending it"", ""they 're more like ideas ripped - off from sketches found in david mamet 's trash""]"
"this was the last carry on movie ( if you discount ' carry on columbus ' as a carry on movie ) and was made by a new production company .
based in central london , this movie is about the attempts by emmanuelle prevert ( suzanne danielle ) to bed her husband emile the french ambassador ( kenneth williams ) .
when he seems unwilling , she is given his permission to bed anyone she likes , such as the prime minister and the u . s . ambassador .
her antics get her into trouble and the british press spread these rumours all over their front pages .
she is invited to talk on television to set the record straight but only confirms the rumours instead .
meanwhile , theodore valentine ( larry dann ) is in love with emmannuelle after a chance encounter in the toilet of the concorde and is determined to marry her .
however , she is only interested in restoring her husband 's ardour which seems a little difficult after emile 's accident with a church spire !
this film is the second worst carry on movie , the worst being ' carry on england ' .
it is embarassing to see some of the remaining regulars struggle through this diabolical script by lance peters and try to pull off some of the crude and tasteless jokes that he has written .
newcomers suzanne danielle and beryl reid ( as mrs .

kenneth williams only appears in a few scenes and his lacklustre performance is warranted , given the script .
the small parts for jack douglas as lyons the butler , joan sims as mrs .
dangle , kenneth connor as leyland the chauffeur , and peter butterworth as richmond , are worthless and embarassing
.
in fact , all four parts are surplus to requirements .
however , the only humourous scene in the film is when the four of them and emmannuelle talk about their most amourous escapades .

"if you have n't plunked down your hard - earned money yet for "" wild wild west , "" the latest summer holiday offering from will smith , let me say right now that your money will be better spent on a starbuck 's frappacino or on a ben & jerry 's sundae .
these treats are great relief from the summer heat .
in contrast , this film made me simmer in disappointment .
i can accept the fact that summer movies tend to put more weight into special effects and that good stories and flavorful characters usually take a back seat .
this was true of star wars episode i , but at least in that film , the story and the characters were still in the back seat .
in this film , they are no where to be found .
what remains are hundreds of male extras costumed as gunslingers and foppish aristocrats , lots of female extras who look like can - can dancers , and a clunky , 80-foot tall instrument of destruction that resembles a mechanical tarantula .
two men are asked to stop this threat .
one is artemus gordon ( kevin kline ) , an inventor who uses his intellect and array of disguises to best his opponents .
among his creations are false breasts and the bulletproof vest .
the other man is jim west ( will smith ) , who prefers the shoot - first - then - shoot - some - more method of investigating .
although their individual talents must be combined to achieve success , their interaction with one another merely seemed like a second rate , two - man vaudevillian act .
for example , there is a scene where west , being more debonair than the reserved gordon , notes that the fake breasts should be filled with water rather than buckwheat , which is what it is currently filled with .
"" now touch my breast , "" west says .
gordon does so and then softly coos his approval .
i found myself groaning at this kind of silliness .
the script fails to generate any sense of drama , humor , or fun for that matter .
i did enjoy kline 's reserved performance , but was surprised at how much latitude they gave to smith .
could it be that will smith
is just so bankable that he 's not even required to act ?

""
now i have to admit , the trailer for this rock - opera - turned - major motion picture is almost breath - taking for some .
the soundtrack is wonderful to listen to .
so why would n't the movie be wonderful to see .
simple , a little over 2 hours of constant singing can almost drive you insane .
the story of eva duarte ( madonna ) , evita is full of drama that 's trapped inside by all the notes and chords .
she was an orphaned child who ends up becoming a hooker , then goes into the field of acting , and finally meets juan peron ( price ) , the soon - to - be first president of argentina .
they fall in love and eventually marry .
sounds pretty good , does n't it .
well the story gets better , as eva goes on the "" rainbow tour "" across europe , trying to win respect .
eva duarte was a wonderful lady .
however , all of the drama - packed moments above were never understood because the actors and actresses sang to fast to be understood .
i went into theater 4 at magic cinemas with the attitude that evita was going to be terribly boring
and i left with happy , because i was right .
they only thing that kept me awake during the movie was the loud bangs of the drums and strums of the guitar .
although it did come off as dull , the beautiful cinematography is eye - catching , as was madonna 's performance .
as the "" spiritual leader of argentina , "" madonna would have definitely been an oscar - contender had she spoken a single line .
but her chance was taken away with the stubbornness of making an exact replica of the broadway musical a film .
do n't get me wrong and do n't look at my grade .
i am not a big fan of musicals on the big screen .
if you 're going to pay to see a movie , you want to see a movie .
now i have to admit , it 's a lot cheaper to pay $ 5 than $ 200 plus to see the play , but that 's what did me in .
all this review contains is my opinion and my grade was set before i even saw the movie .
now you may be saying , "" what kind of critic is he ? , "" and you 're right .
as a critic , i should have given the movie a chance .
but as a 17-year old quentin tarantino fan , it was way too hard . ,",0,"['dull', 'her chance was taken away with the stubbornness', 'can almost drive you insane', 'terribly boring']"
"there is nothing like american history x in theaters or on video .
no other feature film takes such a cold hard look at the lure , the culture , and the brotherhood of white supremacy .
nice guy ed norton jr .
( who sang in everyone says i love you )
plays derek , a twenty - year old skinhead .
dad 's subtle racism grew large in derek , after gang members killed his father .
dad was fighting a fire when they shot him .
now derek keeps his head shaved and has a giant swastika tattooed over his heart .
derek is more interested in the ideas of white supremacy than in its culture of violence .
at a basketball court , black and white tempers flare .
derek channels the aggression into a game , black versus white , for ownership of the courts .
when the choice presents itself , derek goes for game point instead of the sucker - punch .
cameron ( stacy keach ) steps in to derek 's life as a surrogate father .
he takes derek under his wing and nurtures his racist feelings .
keeping his own criminal record spotless , he uses derek as a leader and organizer for high - visibility racial intimidation .
derek obliges by leading his younger and dumber friends in race - motivated mob crimes .
at the bottom of the chain , derek 's younger brother danny ( edward furlong , made famous in terminator 2 ) joins the skinheads not for ideological or intellectual reasons , but because he admires his brother and he wants to belong .
one night three black youths break into derek 's truck , which is exactly what derek has been waiting for .
outside in his shorts and his tattoo , he shoots them all .
the third would - be thief , unarmed , is only wounded .
in the key scene of the film , derek commands the kid into a position where he can be killed with one glorious , enraptured , awful stomp .
( the fun - spoiling nc-17 of orgazmo seems even more inappropriate , considering american history x was rated r .
what sort of country is this that says sex comedies are a bigger threat to our youth than brutal , ecstatic violence ? )
the police arrive just as derek kills the last thief .
derek does not resist the cops , and as they spin him around to cuff him , the film slows down .
derek raises his eyebrows and smiles at his little brother in a chilling , sadistic , satisfied grin .
now in prison , derek faces new challenges .
as the black man in the laundry tells him , "" in the joint , you the nigra , not me .
""
there is a clique of swastika - wearing skinheads , but they are not interested in the ideology of white supremacy .
they only use the symbols as a means of intimidation .
derek finds himself truly alone , truly in danger , and truly afraid .
when derek finally gets out of prison , he finds that his friends from the gang have also changed .
without derek 's leadership , they have shunned the white supremacist ideology for the white supremacist culture .
it is the final factor that makes him realize how badly he 's screwed up .
in the end , he spends quality time with is brother trying to undo the respect and admiration he had earlier inspired in danny .
the film ends a little too deliberately , too neatly after the unchained emotion and violent glee of the rest of the film , but it barely detracts from the overall experience .
edward norton gives an oscar - worthy performance .
although some of his dialogue seemed to be written without enough conviction , norton 's performance compensated .
( an example that comes to mind is his pep talk before looting the store . )
he also captured the essence of an older brother .
he took his responsibility as a role model to his younger brother very seriously , very lovingly , both before and after his change of heart .
though clearly not for all tastes , this film is bold and daring .
the subject matter is ugly , cruel , and at times hard to look at .
nevertheless its subjects are part of humanity 's great face .
kaye gives us a good look at this fascinating , if distasteful , american subculture .",1,"['gives an oscar - worthy performance', 'gives us a good look', 'this film is bold and daring']"
"sometimes , when i decide to write a short story or a poem , i think of a title first , and then think of a subject to go with it .
it seems that the makers of disturbing behavior had a similar train of thought when it came to the title sequence .
i would n't be surprised if a couple of guys got together and created the opening credits , and then someone saw it and made up a story to go along with it .
the title sequence is so good , so ominous and original , that it had me engrossed before the picture even began .
of course , my attention dwindled shortly into the film .
disturbing behavior , like so many thrillers , starts off interesting and ends up
laughably ridiculous .
it 's a teen horror film with no interesting violence or sex .
it 's a suspense film with no suspense .
it 's an evil small town story with no story to speak of .
it 's a disaster , a listless and uninspired disaster , that just barely misses one - stardom because of a few good sequences , a mercifully short running time , and one terrific set of opening credits .
our main man is a fellow named steve clark , blandly played by jimmy marsden .
he moves to a small town with his family after , tragically , his brother shoots himself .
steve is very upset about the untimely death of his brother ; we learn this through strange home - video like nightmares that he has occasionally .
the big trial for steve is , of course , to fit in at school and make new friends .
marsden looks like your stereotypical jock down to the last detail , so he seems a poor casting choice for a social reject .
as a social reject , he falls in with some pretentious dope - smoking philosophers , gavin ( nick stahl ) and rachel ( katie holmes ) .
gavin informs steve that the local group of jocks , known as the blue ribboners , are actually a bunch of zombies , assimilating new members into their group , while sporadically killing innocent people .
so , it 's up to our group of mismatched protagonists to 1 ) solve the mystery , and
2 ) do something about it .
by the end of it all , something has happened and things have been explained , but the film still does n't make any sense .
disturbing behavior was written by scott rosenberg .
i 've seen his name around recently ( he was one of the toucher - uppers on the armageddon script ) , and i imagine that , for the most part , he knows what he 's doing when it comes to screenwriting .
he did , however , have a complete lapse in judgement when he got the idea for this film , and then decided to actually take the time to write it out .
evil small town films are pretty common ( the last one , phantoms , is also a dismal failure ) , but it takes a lot of skill to make the formula work .
rosenberg 's script is a complete mess , lacking in even the most basic attempts at characterization .
and it makes no sense , nor is their any purpose when things are finally "" explained .
""
there is supposed to be an element of surprise when we see what is happening to the jocks , but the film never explains exactly what * is * happening .
they get strapped to chairs , a microchip is inserted into their eyes , and -- poof -- they become sex - crazed , superviolent , machine - like creatures .
the doctor responsible for all this , dr .
caldicott ( bruce greenwood ) , must be pretty nuts for thinking that this kind of behavior is a step up from the way high school jocks actually behave ( or , perhaps , this is the only realistic element in the film ) .
much of the writing is simply bad , and rosenberg has no intuition when it comes to the way high school kids act . in one terrible scene , gavin explains to steve all of the high school cliques , while pointing them out in the cafeteria .
up front , i should say that , in four years of high school , i did not eat in the cafeteria even once .
that aside , the various social groups he points out are general , uninteresting , and poorly - shown .
for instance , he points to the "" nerds , "" who are all wearing glasses and playing with their laptops .
it 's such an obvious cliche that i ca n't believe rosenberg even bothered .
most of the dialogue is forced ( no one says , "" bite me !
"" anymore ) , and none of the scenes have any degree of wit .
this picture is not inspired , and most scenes flop from one to the other , with no sense of momentum or energy .
the blame for this can be placed on director david nutter , who apparently likes his films dry .
horror films should at least exploit violence , but this one is shockingly timid .
there are a few good scenes , though , such as an interesting trip through an insane asylum ( this is , however , the most forced scene in the film , for how our heroes get there or why they bother are things we never learn ) .
i also liked the school janitor character , played by william sadler .
he has a few lines that are surprisingly thought - provoking .
the acting is largely a waste of talent .
marsden is , as i said , bland ( thought not particularly bad ) .
bruce greenwood is shamelessly wasted .
stahl and holmes both show they have talent , but the direction is n't good enough to hone in on their skills
( stahl 's performance seems more like a parody of high school potheads ) .
none of these characters expand beyond their one dimension , and , frankly , watching cardboard cut - outs of human beings run down hallways while screaming just is n't all that cool .
disturbing behavior is a wreck of a film , and it started out a wreck before shooting even began .
i 'm surprised there were producers who read this script and thought that it would make a good film , or that it would make a lot of money at the box office .
it 's not boring , or even blatantly awful , but
it 's an uninspired lump of a film .
it sure starts off nicely , but the regression into total absurdity is so consistent that the very last scene is outright laughable
.
so , if you go to see this film , take my advice : appreciate the credit sequence , and pray it never ends .",0,"['blandly played', 'much of the writing is simply bad', 'in one terrible scene', 'laughably ridiculous', 'none of the scenes have any degree of wit', 'script is a complete mess , lacking in even the most basic attempts at characterization', ""it 's an uninspired lump of a film"", 'shamelessly wasted', 'a wreck of a film , and it started out a wreck before shooting even began', 'most scenes flop from one to the other , with no sense of momentum or energy', 'this one is shockingly timid', 'the acting is largely a waste of talent', 'my attention dwindled shortly into the film', 'the regression into total absurdity is so consistent that the very last scene is outright laughable', 'it makes no sense', ""it 's a disaster , a listless and uninspired disaster""]"
"no filmmaker deconstructs a story as well as atom egoyan .
i 'm referring , specifically , to the narrative form .
in the sweet hereafter , egoyan tells his story in a similar framework to his exotica or the adjuster .
said story , of a fatal school bus accident in the small town of sam dent , british columbia , that shatters the morale of the locals , is told in a most unstraightforward manner .
when the film opens , the accident has already happened , and stephens ( the wonderful holm ) , a polite ambulance - chaser , has arrived with the promise of a lawsuit that will eek out the truth of what really occurred that fateful morning .
throughout , we get to meet the parents of the dead , broken souls who follow stephens like "" the pied piper "" ( passages of which are read during the film ) .
but there is one living passenger , the paralyzed nicole ( polley ) , whose dark secrets of a life before the accident may affect her decision to testify .
we finally do see the accident , about three quarters into the film , which is a stunning visual effect .
a horrific long take that shows the bus sliding , then stopping , then collapsing into a frozen lake , is the best digital trickery in any movie this year
and , perhaps , ever , in a motion picture .
the fractured narrative also intercuts a preoccupied stephens on an airplane , traveling to meet his hiv - positive runaway daughter , as well as glimpses of the artificially happy lives these people led pre - accident .
i have a problem not with the story or story structure , but with egoyan 's heavy- handedness behind the camera .
for the first hour or so , i can quite honestly say i was on the verge of tears ; these are miserable , miserable people .
but that 's just the problem : so anguished are these folk that sympathy wanes after a while , when a lot of sadness becomes too much .
also , a subplot involving incest rings untrue .
perhaps it would n't feel so contrived if it were n't shot in such a tasteful manner .
there are two characters who are father and daughter ; when they first appeared i thought they were lovers .
i was half - right .
nevertheless it 's worth - seeing .
the delightful critic geoff pevere recently wrote that "" american films are about action , canadian films are about consequences , "" hence a recent wave of films about the effects of shock and death from toronto directors , including crash and kissed .
the sweet hereafter is much better
than either of these two films , simply because it 's not boring
or , in the case of kissed , afraid of its own material ( necrophilia ) .
egoyan is a fine , fine , postmodern storyteller , whose work is entertaining , edgy and smart , if a bit too intellectual at times .
though i harped on the weightiness of the material ,
i was always absorbed , engrossed , and surprised by the sweet hereafter .",1,"['much better', 'i was always absorbed , engrossed , and surprised', 'entertaining , edgy and smart', ""it 's not boring"", 'a fine , fine , postmodern storyteller', 'is the best digital trickery in any movie this year', ""nevertheless it 's worth - seeing"", 'deconstructs a story as well as']"
"alien 3 is the only alien film i have seen in theaters .
i saw it when i was 13 years old , and i must admit that i did n't like it .
of course , i was expecting aliens again , and i believe this was my fault .
in order to appreciate alien 3 , you need to see aliens , but you also have to wipe away all the expectations from its predecessor .
james cameron 's aliens was an action film , and many people consider it the best in the series .
i am among that group , but alien 3 is an extremely entertaining film , which critics have bashed for its originality .
many thought the final chase scene went on for too long , and many others thought that the film was too much dialogue and not enough action .
both are untrue , because the film has quite a bit of action , and the dialogue was essential and well - written .
as for the chase sequence , it was long , but not overly long , creating quite a bit of suspense from confusion .
perhaps watching alien 3 on video helped .
on the big screen , i was overwhelmed by something i normally did n't see .
it was a very dark film , and the language was extremely harsh .
i had always figured the alien series to rely on smart dialogue instead of moronic profanities .
do n't get me wrong -- i'm not saying films should eliminate swearing , but when a film substitutes dialogue with these profane remarks , it gets rather distracting .
however , since seeing it again , i realize that the swearing is mainly just an aspect of the restrained hatred in the characters .
as a result , alien 3 's only flaw ( albeit a major one ) is the underdeveloped characters .
we never really care about any of them , and i get the feeling that many scenes were cut in order to shorten the length of the movie .
there were only two characters i liked , and of course one was lt .
ripley ( sigourney weaver ) , although we have gotten to know her through two other films .
the other character was dr .
clemens ( charles dance ) , but
because we like him , the inevitable occurs .
alien 3 begins exactly where aliens left off .
the prologue of alien 3 is a pure cinematic achievement by director david fincher , who had only directed music videos before his chance with this alien entry .
without using a single line of dialogue ( unless you count computer warnings ) , fincher sets up the entire film .
an impressive aspect of this is that fincher only shows a few seconds of film before cutting to a title card .
we see lt .
ripley and the little girl in their cryogenic compartments .
. .
( title ) . . .
a shot of an alien egg .
. .
( title ) . . .
alien legs stretch up into the air .
. .
( title ) . . .
and so on and so on .
during these first ten minutes , i learned everything i had to in order for alien 3 to proceed .
it 's quite a remarkable opening , and one which will remain in my mind for a long time .
because of this face - hugger which has been hatched aboard the vessel from aliens , the hypersleep containers are sent into an escape pod , and sent down to the nearest planet : fiorina fury-161 , an ore refinery which has been turned into a maximum security prison .
however , the face - hugger managed to attach itself to one of the cryo - tubes , and is sent down with the escape pod .
unfortunately , during the landing , all but one of the survivors from aliens is killed .
ripley is discovered by some of the inmates and taken back to the refinery .
of course , you need a carrier for this face - hugger , and it attachs itself to the dog which came with the team of inmates .
ripley is revived and asks to see the ship .
after seeing a mysterious acid - eaten section , ripley asks to see the dead bodies , and then have them cremated .
this cremation scene is one of the most powerful and impressive of all the alien films . featuring a monologue from dillon ( charles s . dutton ) , a prisoner who has found god , the movie cuts back and forth from the ceremony to the dog 's demise .
it 's one of the most memorable moments , as the speech reflects exactly what is going on with the dog .
and this is where alien 3 succeeds .
fincher normally injects a lot of symbolism into his films , and
i can easily see him becoming the next stanley kubrick or alfred hitchcock
( in fact , he is the mixture of both ) .
fincher knows exactly what to film and how to film it , and i figure that he will be one of the few directors with complete control over his films .
alien 3 is riddled with symbolic speeches and metaphorical images .
by doing so , fincher creates some of the best scenes in the entire alien franchise .
many people have criticized fincher 's filming of the death scene of ripley ( i reveal nothing by saying this ) as looking too fake , but i enjoy and relish in the portrayal .
showing ripley fall in slow motion is a nice touch , but by actually not showing her hit the vat of iron , a great deal of symbolism is derived .
i feel that it would have spoiled the mood of the entire film if they had actually shown her splash into the molten iron .
however , most people seem to want to witness ripley die ( which creates a paradox , as she is the character i did n't want to see die ) .
why she is killed is one of the surprises of the film , and i do n't plan on spoiling that in this review .
>
from every alien film comes several memorable moments which seem to stick with you forever .
in alien , it was , of course , the moment the alien burst out of kane 's stomach .
in aliens , it was the showdown between alien and ripley in a machine .
alien 3 has several , but
most memorable is the terrific shot involving the alien and ripley .
ripley is pushed up against a wall , and the alien stands inches away from her .
why it does n't kill her is a shocker , which later leads to a surprise ending .
fincher apparently loves to use close - ups of actors ' faces ( michael douglas and the clown face - off in the game in the same style ) , and by shaving off the actors ' hair , the only thing we have to look at is their faces .
many critics did n't like all the actors being bald , but it makes complete sense when taken in context of the plot .
most of alien 3 works when you take it in context of the story , but when you try to compare it to its predecessors , fincher 's turn seems a bit gloomy and dark , though that 's not always a bad thing .
the plot is pretty much a rehash of the first two films , with some major twists .
again , we are setup with several different characters , and one by one , they are picked off .
however , while the first two had tons of arsenal ( especially cameron 's film ) , alien 3 takes place on a planet devoid of human life except for this run - down prison .
as a result , no weapons are to be found .
this creates a lot of tension , although i must admit that fincher could have added a lot more suspense .
as an alien film , alien 3 is the worst of the series , but by itself ,
it is an extremely well - made motion picture , with a lot more merits than not .
the unfortunate thing surrounding this second sequel is the one - dimensional characters .
i never was really emotionally involved on screen because most of the characters are hardcore criminals whom i really could care less about .
despite this , ripley was the central figure , and that 's what is important .
we care for her , even though she began to act just like one of the guys .
again , the technical side of this film is remarkable , and better than the two previous versions .
while cameron 's version was a pumped up action film with massive artillary , fincher uses brilliant camera angles , terrific lighting , and moody sets .
the cinematography , by alex thomson , is very well done , with a terrific chase sequence towards the end of the movie .
the confusion of the ending draws the viewer in , as we are just as confused as the actors who are being chased around .
the yellows , reds , and oranges of the lights create a dark mood , and by themselves create a lot of suspense .
shadows dance on the walls , and yet those shadows could easily be the alien .
the alien is different from its predecessors this time around , and the swiftness of this alien is quite intense .
the camera likes to take up the perspective of the alien , racing after the characters .
the sets are quite incredible , which are reminiscient of the nostromo from alien .
the narrow corridors and labrynthine hallways is well constructed .
the sets appear to be in the future , but not too far in the future .
one of the set pieces even aids in the destruction of the alien ( nothing surprising there ) .
sigourney weaver turns out yet another good performance , equaling her portrayal of ripley in aliens .
she was snubbed at the oscars for this one , mainly because the film was a critical bomb .
her reactions are far more realistic in this film , with her crying over the loss of the little child she risked her life saving in her previous encounter .
it 's quite touching really .
charles s .
dutton is very strong in his performance
as one of the inmates , and i was on the brink of actually caring for him .
charles dance turns in a nice low - key performance , and as a result , i cared for him immediately .
lance henriksen makes a brief appearance as bishop ii , but he was more entertaining in aliens .
the rest of the cast is pretty stale , though pete postlethwaite sticks out due to his recent turns in the usual suspects and the lost world .
alien 3 is rated r for strong violence and language , and sex .
although it has its flaws , alien 3 is highly entertaining with rich symbolism .
this film reminds you how much fun it is to spot metaphorical images throughout a movie .
while kubrick may have a moral message throughout his films , fincher relies on cinematic devices to bring his meanings out .
it 's a film like fincher 's which reminds us that it is okay for a film to sacrifice quality for quantity ( the final scene ) .
in fact , it tells us that we , as a society , have become too critical of things which may happen to look a little "" fake .
""
whenever something looks fake on screen , we immediately point it out as a mistake .
but perhaps it is n't a mistake .",1,"['an extremely entertaining film', 'it is an extremely well - made motion picture , with a lot more merits than not', 'this cremation scene is one of the most powerful and impressive of all the alien films', 'knows exactly what to film and how to film it , and i figure that he will be one of the few directors with complete control over his films', 'reminds you how much fun it is', 'i enjoy and relish in the portrayal', 'well constructed', 'turns out yet another good performance', 'draws the viewer in', 'an impressive aspect of this is', 'i can easily see him becoming the next stanley kubrick or alfred hitchcock', 'quite a bit of action , and the dialogue was essential and well - written', 'one of the most memorable moments', 'most memorable is the terrific shot', 'the technical side of this film is remarkable , and better than the two previous versions', ""it 's quite touching really"", 'is a nice touch', 'this is where alien 3 succeeds', 'is very well done , with a terrific chase sequence', 'the sets are quite incredible', 'very strong in his performance', 'highly entertaining with rich symbolism', 'are far more realistic in this film', 'turns in a nice low - key performance', ""it 's quite a remarkable opening"", 'creates some of the best scenes', 'uses brilliant camera angles , terrific lighting']"
""" holy man "" boasts a sweet , gentle , comic performance from an unusually subdued eddie murphy and a few moderately funny skits .
unfortunately , to get to the good stuff you have to sit through a painfully long set - up , loads of tedious filler , interminable shots of jeff goldblum stammering and twitching ,
a superfluous romantic subplot and quite possibly the most annoying performance of robert loggia 's career .

"" holy man "" attempts to be several things at once .
it tries to satirize home shopping networks , but it 's difficult to effectively make fun of something that is already a self - parody .
the film attempts to teach us that collecting material possessions is merely a futile attempt to fill the spiritual holes in our hearts , but that 's common knowledge already .
"" holy man "" also tries to present a story of redemption , as ricky hayman tries to decide whether to exploit g 's good will to achieve financial security or do the right thing at the expense of his career .

murphy is delightful and the film takes off whenever he 's onscreen .
unfortunately , he 's not onscreen enough .
jeff goldblum gets the lion 's share of screen time and his tired storyline weighs the proceedings down .
as his potential love interest , kelly preston tries to brighten things up , but she transforms from an all - business media shark to an empathic softy far too quickly and the abrupt change reeks of contrivance .

eve 's bio - rhythms go off the scale each time one of her kinfolk "" mates , "" which we are forced to witness in gross - out detail , but otherwise there does n't appear to be a whole lot of reason why henstridge is in this film , unless it was written into her contract ( let 's hope it cited one sequel and one sequel only ) .

peter boyle is totally wasted as an institutionalized scientist who screams "" i told 'em not to go !

at the top of his lungs , referring to the mars mission but more likely aimed at the makers of this piffle .

laura baker , the one subjecting eve to the tv reruns .
they 're both unbelievably wooden .
what 's a talented filmmaker like peter medak ( "" the ruling class , "" "" the krays , "" "" let him have it "" ) doing directing this tripe
, i wonder .
it 's an unfortunate trend ,
this : once - talented directors throwing in the towel and lending their names to unchallenging horror flicks like "" species ii .
""
last year peter hyams gave us "" the relic "" ; no thanks necessary there .
and the first "" species "" was helmed by roger donaldson who , although certainly no genius behind the camera , had demonstrated much better judgment with his previous choice of projects .
is it just that there are no better offers out there ?
"" species ii "" is worthless . worse than that , it 's also exploitative , offensive , and insulting to the intelligence at every turn .
it 's not that there is n't anything positive to say about the film .

"the happy bastard 's 30-second review big daddy happy gilmore as a father ?
of course !
that 's the latest scenario presented by adam sandler in the new movie big daddy , a movie that 's passable but is n't really considered some of sandler 's best work .
he does n't actually play happy gilmore in the movie , but a variation of him .
he 's sonny coufax , a man who 's living off a settlement he got for a cab running over his foot and his one - day - a - week gig as a tollbooth man ( tollbooth willie ? ) .
his girlfriend ( kristy swanson ) is fed up with his lifestyle and demands a change before she leaves him .
enter a 5-year old kid , who 's mysteriously dropped at his doorstep and intended for his preppy roommate ( jon stewart ) , who 's off in china on a business trip .
from there , coufax basically acts as the kid 's father , teaching him different things like peeing on the side of a building and tripping up skateboarders with sticks .
he even manages to use the kid in a sort of con game to get the attention of a beautiful law office worker ( joey lauren adams ) , but , somehow , he also garners the attention of social services , who are n't particularly pleased with coufax 's actions , as he pretends to be his roommate to keep the kid .
the reason i say it 's not really sandler 's best work is because it gets really sappy towards the end of a movie , showing some odd feelings that somehow did n't really belong in a sandler vehicle .
i mean , it fits the movie 's tone and everything , and sandler handles it well
,
but it 's just oddly placed , that 's all .
fortunately , it does n't destroy the goofy glee path it 's been following and
it still makes you feel good .
sandler does a good job here , as he does in most of his movies .
rob schneider , however , is irritating as his friend , an immigrant delivery boy who ca n't read .
stewart
, in his minor time on screen , is great , and adams remains a joy to watch .
look for steve buscemi as well as a homeless bum .
he 's a hoot .
directed by dennis dugan ( director of happy gilmore ) , the movie remains a good couple of hours to pass the time with .

no terror , no tension ; nothing .
without any weight , wit , or wonder to propel the story , the viewer is left with little more to do than pay attention to the period detail , a few buckets of blood , and stuart craig 's fabulously dreary production design .

"by now i figured i 'd seen every alfred hitchcock film at least a half - dozen times -- not that i 'm complaining .
to call him the "" master of suspense "" is an understatement .
the paradine case ( 1947 ) , admittedly one of hitchcock 's lesser movies , turned out to be one i 'd missed .
this one , like all hitchcock films , is well worth savoring .
the story opens with the rich mrs .
maddalena anna paradine being arrested in her home for poisoning her blind husband .
as mrs .
paradine , alida valli plays an aloof but alluring woman of the world .
to franz waxman 's stark and moody music , we see the prison guards divesting her of her luxurious garments and jewels .
stripped of her fine raiment , she becomes a commoner again , which , as it turns out , was what she was before she met her husband .
""
a brief skirmish , and you 'll be lunching at the savoy again , "" anthony keane , her ultraconfident attorney tells her in their first meeting , predicting a fast and easy trial .
gregory peck plays the successful and debonair barrister .
""
she 's no murderess , "" he argues simplistically , smitten by her beauty .
""
she 's too fine a woman .
""
his attitude upsets his beautiful and increasing jealous wife , gay ( ann todd ) .
unlike most hitchcock movies , which are centered on the thriller and the mystery , this one is more a romantic melodrama .
typical is the scene in which gay flings her head back and shakes her hair while bathed in light .
she deflects her husband 's affections as she fears that he is beginning to fall in love with his client .
the dramatic music then comes up high as the camera dwells on mrs .
paradine 's portrait nearby .
in the relatively unsatisfying first half , little happens other than domestic squabbles and overtones of intense adulterous desires .
to the sound of sweeping violins
gay tells anthony that he must get mrs .
paradine acquitted because , if mrs .
paradine dies , his heart will go with her .
if she is freed , he will be able to forget her .
as part of the soap opera , a mysterious louis jordan plays mr .
paradine 's valet , who has had some not to be discussed relationships .
charles coburn plays anthony 's legal partner , sir simon flaquer .
and charles laughton , who looks like coburn , is judge lord horfield .
this being proper british society , they will all dine together at the judge 's house not long before the case begins .
court tv junkies will probably pick up the many differences , some subtle and others not , between the american and the british judicial systems .
one , for example , of which i was not aware is that the barrister can not speak to his own client during the recess if she is the process of testifying .
one sometimes wonders what the academy is thinking when they make their oscar nominations .
as the judge 's wife , lady sophie horfield , ethel barrymore got a nomination for best supporting actress -- the film 's only nomination -- for an inconsequential part with which she did little of merit .
( so the big question is when does hitchcock make his obligatory walk - on ?
at 37 minutes into the film , he leaves a train station carrying a large musical instrument case .
do n't miss it . ) in the second half the story finally comes alive when it gets into the courtroom .
the great master shows his hand there as the tensions build as rapidly in the second part as they lay fallow in the first .
watch how the camera angles are sometimes from the back and other times from way on high to set the exact tone for the trial 's action .
as anthony explains it , the simple case has only 3 possibilities : mr .
paradine poisoned himself , mrs .
paradine did it , or the valet did it .
the end includes many devastating revelations and some nice twists so it is too bad
the first half is so languid .
the paradine case runs 1 : 53 .
the picture is in black and white .
it is not rated but would be pg for mature themes and would be fine for kids around nine and up if they are interested .",1,"['to call him the "" master of suspense "" is an understatement', 'some nice twists', 'the story finally comes alive', 'the great master shows his hand there', 'like all hitchcock films , is well worth savoring']"
"leonardo decaprio ( what 's eating gilbert grape ) and claire danes ( tv 's my so called life )

surrounded by a superb supporting cast , in - cluding paul sorvino ( goodfellas ) , brian dennehy ( tommy boy ) , pete poslethwaite ( the usual sus - pects ) and john leguizamo ( executive decision ) , decaprio and danes

the story starts off at a gas station , where the "" montague boys "" meet the "" capulet boys "" and square off with one another .
symbolizing the swords of shakespeare 's day were their weapons , like the "" rapier-9 mm "" or the "" longsword- shotgun .
"" instead of killing each other right away , they shoot around , just like in sword fights of old .
another great thing about the film was the performance of harold perrineau as romeo 's best friend .
mercutio , who in shakespeare 's novel was quite a stud , was portrayed as an afri - can - american cross - dresser
whose violent na - ture , was a definite plus .
miriam margoyles , a virtually unknown actress was astounding as juliet 's nurse , even though she was never given a name .
she was the only one who could keep juliet out of her fantasy world .
verona was the home of the rival families in shakespeare 's version , only slightly changed in luhrmann 's . now known as verona beach , the capulet 's ( led by sorvino ) and
montague 's ( led by dennehy ) are now rival corporate dynasties .
and their small family skirmishes were now huge gang wars .
one slight problem with the film was the difficulty to comprehend the dialogue , since it was spoken in old english .
sub - titles could have helped in the beginning of the movie , but toward the end , it became easier to understand .
this excellent movie poses another prob - lem : what genre is it ?
romeo & juliet contains so much drama , yet enough comedy and action to be placed in either of those categories .

"-- comedy , rated pg , runs about 1 : 40 -- starring : john goodman , kathy moriarty , and a bunch of teenagers -- directed by joe dante and written by charles hass -- summary : lawrence woolsley ( john goodman ) brings his new horror film mant !
to premiere in key west during the height of the cuban missile crisis .
he hopes to capitalize on the tense moment by providing an escape for the town .
we see most of the events through the stories of four teenagers and how life affects them .
quick and easy review : i really enjoyed matinee .
the mixture of comedy and tension blended nicely .
unlike many comedies this film tries , and succeeds , in getting past the stage of doing anything for a laugh .
the makers of the film also cared about telling an intelligent story .
the performances of all the principals are right on the mark , particularly john goodman as the schlock master .
so i would definitely recommend this film to anyone looking for a light hearted , yet interesting way to spend a couple of hours .
longer , more detailed review : [ beware of spoilers ] the primary reason
i enjoyed this film was , that while being a comedy , the film also had an intelligent story to tell .
too many comedies today subscribe to the the notion that a comedy need only make you laugh .
you watch the movie , laugh a lot , leave the theatre and take nothing with you .
matinee is not like that .
i left the picture thinking about what i would do faced with the cuban missile crisis .
i found myself wondering what would happen to the characters of the film .
but most importantly , i found myself caring about what would happen to the characters .
the comedy of the film centers around goodman , his character , and the film he brings to key west .
i believe that goodman is one of the finest comedic actors in the business today .
he is highly expressive both physically and vocally .
i felt he at least deserved an oscar nomination for his work in barton fink .
the other characters are often lost in a scene with him due to his commanding nature , however , while the star , goodman is actually not at the center of the film .
the movie is really the story of the four teenagers , discovering who they are and what they want , against a background where at any minute it could all end .
i thought the kids reaction were highly realistic
.
they tried to block it out , they tried to escape from the concerns of their world .
unfortunately it kept creeping back in , particularly with the fear , and the chaos of the time .
while the comedy centered on goodman , and the drama on the teens , there was a great deal of overlap .
several aspects of the panic are shown in a humorous light .
one example is a scene where people are fighting each other for the the last cans and boxes of food in a grocery store .
if you think about it the threat of nuclear annihilation seems hardly to be the backdrop for a comedy , but it works here .
another reason
i like this film is that i like b- science fiction movies .
one of my favorite films to go watch is plan 9 from outer space .
( note i did not say it was one of my favorite movies , but one of my favorite to see . )
while mant ! never got made , many films like it were , and mant ! serves mostly as dante 's homage to the b - films he loves .
so again i would like to recommend matinee to anybody looking for a good , humorous story .
this is n't a gag film like many other comedies but
an intelligent , well - thought out , film about real people with real problems told in an often hilarious way .
enjoy !",1,"['it works here', 'i really enjoyed', 'i would definitely recommend this film', 'also cared about telling an intelligent story', 'the mixture of comedy and tension blended nicely', 'an intelligent , well - thought out , film about real people with real problems told in an often hilarious way', 'i like this film', 'enjoy !', 'also had an intelligent story', 'this film tries , and succeeds', 'i enjoyed this film', 'matinee is not like that', 'the performances of all the principals are right on the mark', 'i would like to recommend', 'the kids reaction were highly realistic']"
"synopsis : an attractive mute makeup artist , working on an ultra - cheesy slasher movie in moscow , witnesses the production of a brutal snuff film and is subsequently chased by really bad russians .
meanwhile , the artist 's sister and boyfriend clumsily try to save her .
comments : mute witness came as a surprise to me the first time i watched it .
drawn by the clever artwork on the video box , i rented the film expecting a complete turkey .
mute witness , however , was original , offbeat , and well - made .
it 's
one of those cool little finds that no one seems to know about .
i 've subsequently found it at most video rental places i visit , and it may be seen , on occasion , on the independent film channel .
the first hour of mute witness is extremely tense , as billy , the quite believable mute heroine , sees members of the russian mob brutally kill a prostitute while filming an illegal snuff film .
the rest of the film takes good advantage of billy 's vulnerable position as a mute foreigner in moscow being pursued by powerful criminal figures .
to throw a curveball into the fray , billy 's sister karen and her filmmaking beau become bizarre figures of comic relief to offset several violent sequences in what are some genuinely funny scenes .
a disappointingly trite ending and occasional comic blunders are the only two things which mar this otherwise suspenseful film .
look for alec guinness ( obi - wan kenobi from the first star wars trilogy ) in a small role as the evil reaper .
definately check this movie out ; although , as a word of warning , it does contain several scenes of rather grisly violence which certainly are n't for the squeamish .",1,"['one of those cool little finds that no one seems to know about', 'takes good advantage', 'was original , offbeat , and well - made', 'definately check this movie out', 'came as a surprise to me']"
""" saving silverman "" is a good example of a good comedy gone bad
.
as a love story it is good , however as a comedy
it falls flat on it 's face
.
i think throughout the short 90 minutes i laughed a total of seven times . . .
and those were just chuckles at the most !
the movie does n't have the oomph to make it a great movie , and does n't have the script to make it a funny movie .
wayne lefessier ( steven zahn ) ,
j .
d .
mcnugent
( jack black ) , and darren silverman ( jason biggs ) have grown up all their lives together , they have been best friends forever and vow to stay close till the end .
while in a bar after doing a show with their band , based on their love of neil diamond , darren meets a young woman named judith ( amanda peet ) whom he instantly falls for .
wayne and j .
d . however think differently and when judith tells darren that he can never see his friends again
, it 's up to wayne and
j . d . to try and begin saving silverman .
the performances are topnotch and
surprisingly , they are what keep the movie afloat .
jason biggs right off the flop "" loser "" does an ok job playing silverman , but he is stale and flat at times .
steve zahn is perfect in the role of wayne lefessier , and even though the movie is about silverman , lefessier is really the main character and the narrator of the movie itself .
jack black is well jack black , and he does an all right job as j .
d .
but he is n't as funny as he has been in the past .
amanda peet plays the ultimate bitch as judith , and neil diamond plays neil diamond ( he 's better at singing than acting ) .
anyway the performances in the film are good , but it 's too bad the script is n't .
speaking of script , hank nelkan 's choppy script is not only badly written , but not funny enough even for an episode of sesame street .
the trailer for the movie , as with most movies gives away everything that happens in the movie , especially the funniest parts .
somewhere "" saving silverman "" was meant to be a good movie , and it could have been , but alas in the end it was n't .

"kids today , they do n't just want to see heartthrob and master thespian freddie prinze jr .
loving on the ladies .
no , they want to see him doing something that takes a little more in the acting department : namely , playing baseball .
through a series of drippy voiceovers , we are informed that there 's no better proving ground for major league baseball than the cape cod summer baseball leagues , where college also - rans and hopeful dropouts go to play in the hopes of attracting big league attention .
our man freddie has landed a spot as a pitcher on the prestigious chatham a 's , where he is hoping for his big break .
it 's only after he is given ample time to show off his abs and scamper about in a woman 's thong
( do n't ask ) that we learn what the real story of summer catch will be : that prinze is a poor townie named ryan dunne , struggling to make a name for himself ; that neither his father ( fred ward ) nor brother ( jason gedrick ) pulled themselves out of their blue collar jobs and resent anyone who tries ; and that the local beauty tenley -- tenley !
( jessica biel ) -- is so far out of his league that he probably should n't even bother . . .
but of course he makes a play for her .
summer catch also makes an abortive stab at another half a dozen subplots -- the jealousy of fellow townie and brazen slut dee dee ( brittany murphy ) , the alienation felt by ryan 's non - baseball playing best friend ( gabriel mann ) , or the fat chick fetish of fellow player miles ( marc blucas ) .
worst of these is a ludicrous bit involving that ' 70s show 's wilmer valderrama and beverly d'angelo , both of whom appear in the film simply to provide a nutty mrs .
robinson - like substory and to remind you of how much better done that was in bull durham .
in fact , virtually all of summer catch feels like it 's been done better somewhere else . for starters , the film has a major question of identity .
it 's definitely not a sports movie , and it fails pretty miserably at being a romance .
the worst part is the amateurish script ( co - written by an arli$$ writing alumnus and a guy that starred in leprechaun 3 )
, chock - full of phony emotion
.
by the end , it all becomes a platform for each character to deliver a soliloquy to ryan that he must take to heart .
dad is on hand to give fatherly yet drunken advice .
coach ( brian dennehy , just loving the fact that he 's got some work on the big screen ) is on hand to give the curmudgeonly counterpoint .
ryan 's catcher ( matthew lillard , playing himself again ) is on hand to tell ryan to "" play catch "" with him and make fun of the fat fetish guy .
ryan 's stoner best friend is on hand to give the go - get-'em - tiger - we're - behind - you talk .
and the girlfriend is on hand to give heartwarming - nuzzly - follow - your - dreams counsel .
before long , you start to wonder : is freddy prinze jr . is capable of having a thought of his own ?
do n't answer that .
the only real joy in the film is found in biel 's character , and not just because of the skimpy outfits , which are also usually wet .
she 's the only one in the movie that is able to do much with her role , taking the rebelling - against - daddy character to at least a passing grade .
when she 's on screen , the time flies by .
when she 's not , you realize that for some ungodly reason this movie is almost two hours long
.
for a pg-13 teen romance ( despite near - constant sexual innuendo ) , one has to ask warner brothers : what were you thinking ? ? ?
for her part , biel has fallen so far from her 7th heaven roots that she has almost become denise richards .
hollywood is either about to eat her alive . . . or vice versa .
either way , good luck , jessica .
as for freddie , if he keeps pumping teen romances out at the rate of two a year , prinze 's next "" summer catch "" is liable to be a venereal disease .",0,"['what were you thinking ? ? ?', 'chock - full of phony emotion', 'the film has a major question of identity', 'for some ungodly reason this movie is almost two hours long', 'worst of these is a ludicrous bit', 'it fails pretty miserably', 'the worst part is the amateurish script', ""( do n't ask )"", ""feels like it 's been done better somewhere else""]"
"as with any gen - x mtv movie ( like last year 's dead man on campus ) , the movie is marketed for a primarily male audience as indicated by its main selling points : sex and football .
those two items , wrapped in a guilty - pleasure package , are sure to snare a sizeable box office chunk initially , but sales will decline for two reasons .
first , the football sequences are nothing new , nor can they be ; the sports genre is n't mainstream
and it 's been retread to death .
second ,
the sex is just bad .
despite the appearance of a whipped cream bikini or the all - night strip - club party , there 's nothing even remotely tantalizing .
the acting is mostly mediocre , not including the fantastic jon voight .
cultivating his usual sliminess , voight gives an unexpectedly standout performance as west canaan coyotes head coach bud kilmer .
kilmer is the driving force behind the coyotes ' twenty - two conference championships and two state titles in thirty years ; this year he plans to make it twenty - three .
unfortunately , when his star quarterback , lance harbor ( paul walker ) , goes down for the count , he 's got to rely on the unreliable abilities of backup john moxon ( james van der beek ) .
moxon leads the team through its last four games , and then must cope with his newfound stardom , the effect it has on his relationship with girlfriend julie ( amy smart ) , and other temptations that abound in football - crazy west canaan .
most regions of the country are not nearly as football - crazy as texas , and so the atmosphere is likely to be lost on most . similarly , the set design is wrong for a high school setting : the teams are decked out with sparkling uniforms , radio headsets ( which never seem to work , however , and instead require coaches to signal plays manually ) , and even a giant bronze statue of coach kilmer .
these elements ( as well as the heavy drinking and carousing ) might be more appropriate on a college campus -- but mtv 's core audience is the high school demographic .
this focus is further emphasized by the casting : james van der beek , of tv 's "" dawson 's creek , "" is an understandable choice for the reluctant hero , although he never manages to do anything with the role .
other stars are similarly young and unmemorable .
there 's not much that goes right about varsity blues , and there 's not much to like about it , either .
everything herein has already been done , and if it has n't , the movie manages to botch it one way or another .
this is
certainly missable .",0,"['certainly missable', 'the atmosphere is likely to be lost on most', 'sales will decline', 'he never manages to do anything with the role', 'the set design is wrong', ""there 's nothing even remotely tantalizing . the acting is mostly mediocre"", 'manages to botch it', ""there 's not much that goes right about varsity blues , and there 's not much to like about it , either"", 'the sex is just bad']"
"every now and then , reviewers are faced with the films that are hard to be properly reviewed .
most of the time it happens with films that leave so overwhelming impact , either good or bad , that in the end reviewers must work hard to express his thoughts or feelings .
but , sometimes it can happen for rather trivial reasons .
i love trouble happened to be one of such occasions for the author of this review .
the impression left by the film was n't overwhelming - on the contrary , there were hardly any impression at all , since
i had real trouble keeping myself awake while watching it . which surprise me to this day , because the movie theatre was full , i was close to sound speakers , the show was n't late and i did n't lack sleep before the show .
such things happen very rarely to me , and , after many years , the closest thing to solution to this mystery is probably the quality of the film itself .
the plot revolves around two rival chicago reporters - old peter brackett ( nick nolte ) and young , aspiring sabrina peterson ( julia roberts ) .
two of them are assigned to cover the train collision . as soon as they meet , they start scooping each other , but during the process they both discover sinister plot involving cancerogenic milk , and also the romantic feelings they have for each other .
the plot in this film is rather secondary to its real raison d ' ?
tre - romantic pairing reminiscent of classical screwball comedies starring spencer tracy and katharine hepburn .
movie author , director and screenwriter charles shyer , who had some experiences with turning the screwball spirit into modern setting with father of the bride , tries again , this time pairing old nick nolte with young julia roberts .
however , although there is some chemistry between the two , soon it stops to arouse any interest .
it probably happens due to poorly executed genre mix , that collides light - hearted romantic comedy with
rather uninteresting plot suitable to pure action thrillers .
shyer as director fails to make the proper transition between the two , and fails in both areas , making the story cliched and predictable
.
the end result is rather forgettable effort , which convinced me not to watch movie again .

"" so to hell with webster 's -- "" chicken run "" is one of the funnest movies i 've seen in a while .
i ca n't remember the last time i 've seen anything funner .
the chickens at tweedy 's farm are up to something . living in a concentration camp - like atmosphere , they are led by one plucky hen called ginger ( voice of julia sawalha ) who continually comes up with plans for escape -- and always gets caught , subsequently spending day after day in the coal box .
one night , a brash american rooster flies in over the fence , calling himself rocky ( mel gibson ) , famous flying rooster and circus performer .
rocky promises to teach the chickens how to fly , and the situation grows more desperate as the nefarious mrs .
tweedy ( miranda richardson ) decides to abandon the farm 's egg - selling plan for a pie - selling plan .
she orders a huge pie - making machine , cackling , "" chickens go in ; pies come out .
""
what sort of pies ?
chicken pies , of course .
co - director nick park and his studio , aardman animation , produced three oscar - winning short films : "" creature comforts , "" "" the wrong trousers , "" and "" a close shave .
""
the latter two were the second and third installments of a trilogy starring the delightful team wallace & gromit , a man and his dog famous for getting themselves into increasingly peculiar adventures .
part of what made the "" wallace "" films brilliantly entertaining was park 's uncanny ability to make an old story seem new .
""
the wrong trousers , "" for example , pulled out a lot of old hitchcockian suspense tricks , and "" a close shave "" owed a great deal of inspiration to classic detective stories .
but in the hands of park and his team , the stories felt fresh and inspired , and not the least bit contrived .
now teaming with co - director peter lord , park has created a similar creature in "" chicken run .
""
the plot is largely lifted from "" the great escape "" ( watch for a quick reference to the ball - bouncing scene ) , with some spielberg - inspired action sequences providing the excitement .
thing is , the film does n't feel like it 's been lifted from somewhere else ; "" chicken run "" feels fresh , alive , like nothing else ever done
.
part of it is the original idea : who in the world came up with the idea to make a prisoners - of - war movie starring chickens ?
park and lord milk the incongruity for all
it 's worth : the characters treat their situation as if it were dead serious , and to them , it is .
but they 're * chickens * ,
so
it 's funny to us .
another thing that helps "" chicken run "" ( and most of park 's films ) succeed is the animators ' subtle way of giving nods to the very films they 're cribbing .
there are references to "" the great escape , "" obviously , and "" stalag 17 .
""
the chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parodies both "" raiders of the lost ark "" and "" indiana jones and the temple of doom .
""
there 's even a nod to "" the blues brothers , "" if you can believe it , and the filmmakers even get in a little light - hearted ribbing at the expense of their star voice actor , taking a couple of very subtle jabs at mel gibson 's nationality and film history .
the "" braveheart "" reference is a hoot if you catch it .
when you consider just how fine a line resides between a funny parody and a redundant one , "" chicken run "" is downright brilliant in its execution . consider this : since july of last year , i 've seen dozens upon dozens of "" blair witch project "" parodies , on television , on the radio , and online .
out of all those , maybe one or two were amusing , the rest tiresome .
why ?
because once you got past the thought that "" they 're parodying that&#8216 ; blair witch ' movie , "" most of the parodies had nothing to offer -- no insight , no original idea , no greater purpose .
they were only funny if you had seen the movie ; otherwise , you got nothing .
conversely , "" chicken run "" does n't lean on its parodies -- the film references are never the sole focus of any scene .
if you 've never seen "" indiana jones , "" the chase sequence is still fun .
even if you have no idea who mel gibson is , rocky remains an interesting character .
park , lord , and screenwriter karey kirkpatrick realize that an audience does not need a parody shoved in their faces before it 's understood , and as a result , "" chicken run "" is filled with visual and verbal jabs that are never too obvious , but not quite vague either .
enjoyment of this movie does n't require knowledge of film history , but if you 've got it , "" chicken run "" is that much richer .
the voice cast turns in uniformly lively performances , and the characters they play are given so many subtle nuances that it 's hard not to fall in love with every one of them .
ginger is perfect , spunky and opinionated , but with a soft heart that forbids her to leave her companions behind , and julia sawalha ( known as the cute mousy girl on "" absolutely fabulous "" ) nails it .
she has warm , human chemistry with gibson , whose rocky hides his personal doubt under a brash gung - ho veneer .
the characters ' inevitable romance does n't feel contrived , but sweet .
poor mr .
tweedy ( tony haygarth ) suspects the chickens are organizing in some way , but his limited intellect prevents him from figuring things out , and his overbearing wife certainly is n't any help .
jane horrocks delivers a lovely voice characterization as tragically optimistic babs ( a hen that runs away with most of the best one - liners , all while perpetually crocheting a sweater ) , and two supply - trading rats that seem to have walked straight out of a monty python sketch nearly steal the show during the lively central swing - dancing sequence .
they even come up with an inspired riff on something that 's baffled scholars and theologians alike for decades : the chicken vs . egg dilemma .
one might have expected this inevitable joke to come off as wearisome , but as with most of "" chicken run ,
"" it comes as a delightful surprise .
the film manages to cross all barriers
; it should be accessible to both children and adults , brits and yanks , rats and chickens .
the animation is first - rate . remember that this was all done the old - fashioned way , with actual humans moving clay figurines around on a tiny set bit by painstaking bit , and you see just how truly remarkable
"" chicken run "" really is .
this movie possesses that same quality that makes pixar studios ' animation great : precise and unwavering attention to detail .
as in such top - notch family fare as "" a bug 's life "" or "" toy story 2 , "" "" chicken run "" has something to offer in nearly every frame .
certainly a passive viewer can enjoy it as a straightforward story with a worthwhile moral and some surprisingly touching scenes , but a active , attentive viewers will enjoy it even more because they 'll catch all the details .
anyway , the movie 's just
a boatload of fun

"bowfinger is a good movie about the making of a very bad one .
the screenplay , written by co - star steve martin , skewers everything in hollywood from cheesy science - fiction movies to chop - socky fight sequences , and all in a crafty and accomplished manner .
anyone who knows of , or has had any association with movie - making should thoroughly enjoy this clever comedy for it 's entire duration .
the central premise behind the film is an inspired and promising one .
bobby bowfinger ( martin ) , a cheapskate and small - time hollywood producer , has always dreamed of making a successful motion picture but has never attained the proper tools to do so .
a new script , an alien invasion story entitled chubby rain , has caught bowfinger 's eye .
after confronting a big - name producer named jerry renfro ( robert downey jr . )
in a restaurant , an agreement is made to finance the movie .
but first , bowfinger must get renowned action star kit ramsey ( eddie murphy ) to sign in on the project .
kit turns the offer down immediately , but bowfinger still has the intent to shoot the film .
after emptying out his life savings , the hapless producer tells the remaining cast and crew that ramsey is involved , and then prepares to film the movie without the star 's knowledge .
the actors confront ramsey on the street , saying their lines as hidden cameras peek through bushes to capture the footage .
the unknowing star , who is terrified of aliens and being abducted , is brought to believe there is actually pod people after him .
when the conditions become even more treacherous , bowfinger is forced to hire a kit ramsey look - alike named jiff ( also murphy ) , a sweet - natured dork who runs for coffee in - between shooting vital scenes .
these include attempting a suicide run across an 8-lane freeway , and one of the ` hot ' scenes involving supporting actress daisy ( heather graham ) removing her blouse .
bowfinger takes it 's sweet time getting started , but when the plot switches into high gear , great things happen .
certain scenes are so precisely executed , perfectly framing moments that are absolutely fall - down funny .
no , hilarious .
standouts include the chase through a parking garage in which ramsey , who 's supposed to be being followed , keeps checking behind him to investigate a strange tapping noise ( it 's actually bowfinger 's dog in high heels ) .
and just try not to laugh in the climactic kung - fu sequence , featuring jiff in an excerpt from another bowfinger classic entitled fake purse ninjas .
while the entire 97-minutes of bowfinger is n't always on target , individual scenes may have you rolling in the aisles .
masterful comedy director frank oz ( dirty rotten scoundrels , in and out ) , who has never made a bad movie , ensures a quality final product and is aided immensely by martin 's sharp - edged script . however , the real on - screen star is eddie murphy .
this is the actor 's finest work since his breakthrough into the hollywood market in the early 80 's . murphy excels at every corner , not only succeeding with presenting believable paranoia in the eyes of kit ramsey , but in creating a likable buffoon in jiff as well .
these three talented comic minds have squeezed every morsel of potential out of this premise , and the reward is a virtually guaranteed helping of hearty laughs .
steve martin generates the power behind bowfinger , but murphy fuels it .
this is a summer - time comedy that , unlike something such as american pie and south park , does n't break any rules .
but it 's still just as uproarious , or perhaps even more side - splitting than anything we 've seen this season .
the supporting cast , including christine baranski as a work - loving actress and jamie kennedy as the cameraman ,
all perform well within their limits .
the only presence that demands real attention when placed next to martin or murphy is the beautiful heather graham , as the young film star who has plans to sleep her way to the top .
graham , attempting to further her stardom after appearing as the new powers ' girl in ap2 , displays a cheerful but naive persona that nicely corresponds with the wackiness of the screenplay .
i would n't be caught dead buying a ticket for chubby rain , but watching how it all came about is certainly entertaining enough .",1,"['finest work', 'excels at every corner , not only succeeding with presenting believable', 'three talented comic minds', 'the reward is a virtually guaranteed helping of hearty laughs', 'great things happen . certain scenes are so precisely executed , perfectly framing moments that are absolutely fall - down funny . no , hilarious . standouts include', 'individual scenes may have you rolling in the aisles . masterful comedy director', 'the central premise behind the film is an inspired and promising one', 'all perform well', 'is certainly entertaining enough', 'should thoroughly enjoy this clever', 'a good movie', 'the real on - screen star is', ""ensures a quality final product and is aided immensely by martin 's sharp - edged script""]"
"the happy bastard 's quick movie review analyze this how does one do a comedy focused on the mob ?
well , a few years ago , there was a sly little comedy called the freshman , which had marlon brando doing a romp of a send - up of his famous don corleone character and , recently , the utterly stupid ( in a bad way ) movie mafia ! failed to really get the joke .
this time around , however , warner bros .
may have gotten it right with analyze this , a movie that hits its targets
more than it misses .
. .
and for plenty of reasons .
the story goes like this .
a mobster ( robert deniro ) finds himself receiving several panic attacks as of late , fueled by the stress of an upcoming mobster meeting and a near - death following a drive - by shooting .
it 's these attacks that prompt him to hire a psychiatrist ( billy crystal ) who 's mostly reluctant to take the mobster 's case for two reasons .
first , of course , he 's a mobster , but secondly , he 's trying to get married and enjoy a quiet honeymoon with his wife ( lisa kudrow ) and kid .
and , of course , he ca n't rest worth for a moment because the mobster 's goons are always needing the shrink for something , be it a quick consultation or dream analyzation .
fortunately , the movie is played out for plenty of laughs .
director harold ramis ( who also helmed the comedy multiplicity , which was n't half bad ) keeps the tone peppy and light , even if it 's sometimes sprinkled by slight dramatic moments ( shootings ca n't always be taken for laughs , you know ) .
deniro
does some of his finest comic work since the king of comedy , giving off a somewhat similar performance to his role in goodfellas , but with a bit of a lighter heart .
( a scene where he tries to display his anger over the phone and fails miserably is hilarious . )
crystal plays an excellent straight man to deniro 's character , uplifting him from such bombs as father 's day and my giant .
kudrow is also a hoot as crystal 's wife - to - be , who 's on the verge of a breakdown thanks to deniro 's presence .
is the movie perfect ?
not really , thanks to a simplistic ending and some slightly wasted moments with a character portrayed by chazz palminteri
( he 's a comic actor , too , come on , give him some more ! ) , but
it is an enjoyable romp
that lets deniro do something different but same for a change , taking his dramatic act to a new field of comedy . kudos to crystal and kudrow for not just making it his show , either .

"capsule :
gal is a 50s - ish london cockney gangster who has retired to spain .
his old associates want him for one last job and send the vicious don to give him an offer he ca n't refuse .
a standout performance by ben kingsley as don can not save what is
essentially a set of cliches recycled from old westerns .
, 0 ( -4 to +4 ) roger ebert asks in his review of sexy beast , "" who would have guessed that the most savage mad - dog frothing gangster in recent movies would be played by . . .
ben kingsley ?
""
my response would be that anyone who has seen alan arkin in wait until dark , henry fonda in once upon a time in the west , or anthony hopkins in the silence of the lambs should have guessed it .
they should know that the way for a film to create a really creepy sociopath is cast someone who generally plays mild , sympathetic , or even ineffectual character roles .
the same characteristics that make an actor seem gentle in most of his roles can work in his favor when a role calls for him to be fierce and vicious .
that is the principle that works for kingsley in sexy beast .
gary "" gal "" dove ( played by ray winstone ) has retired from a london career of crime and is living on a luxurious villa in spain .
life has become a routine of sunning himself and relaxing .
but his paradise is about to be shattered by a one - two - punch .
the first punch is a boulder that comes rolling down the hill next to the villa .
the second punch comes from gal 's past .
back in london
gang boss teddy bass
( ian mcshane , tv 's lovejoy ) is planning to break into a safety deposit room in a bank and he wants gal .
he sends his most rabid henchman don logan ( ben kingsley ) to fetch gal .
don will accept any decision gal makes from "" yes "" to "" certainly .
"" however , if gal says "" no "" don will do whatever it takes to turn it into a yes including threatening guy 's ex - porn- star wife deedee ( amanda redman ) . in the meantime don knows just how to get under everybody 's skin .
kingsley makes don a compact package of fury and nastiness .
there are some serious problems in louis mellis 's and david scinto 's script that should have been caught before filming .
when we see the actual crime we have no idea why gal was so important to its success .
beyond an ability to use skin - diving gear , no special talents are required of him .
any local hood could have done what gal is needed for .
additionally the crime involves digging from a swimming pool to the bank vault , flooding the vault .
no only
could they have let the water out of the pool and avoided the complication altogether , but there is by far too much water to be accounted for by what was in the pool .
in spite of the provocative title , the story is cliched and overly familiar .
i know i have seen all the plot elements of sexy beast in old westerns like the law and jake wade .
the story is usually of the reformed outlaw , a robert taylor type , who has hung up his guns and is trying for a life of peaceful respectability .
the old gang , however , wants to do one more job with their old buddy and sends a rabid richard widmark type to go and git ?
i m .
it is not a great plot .
in sexy beast even the plot twists have gray beards .
perhaps the film has a little more respectability because it was made not as a western but as a stylish british gangster film .
it is an old plot dressed up to look new .
if the plot is old , at least the style is creative .
this is director jonathan glazer 's first film , but he has reputedly done some notable tv ads for guinness stout .
his style does have some unexpected touches including some very odd dream sequences .
cinematographer ivan bird uses a lot of half lit scenes .
we see one side of a person 's faces .
but the other side fades into the darkness , a sort of metaphor for the half - world these characters in - habit .
half of everything that is happening is also kept hidden .
we yanks will have a hard time with some of the dialog .
at least in my theater it was difficult to make out the words with the quiet speaking , the heavy accents , and the cockney language .
sexy beast is a very and familiar minor plot lent respectability in the us by being done in what is here a still somewhat novel genre , the london crime film .
the plot may be new to british crime films , but it would be overly familiar as a western .
further respectability comes from ben kingsley 's high - powered performance .
i give it a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale .",0,"['the story is cliched and overly familiar', 'it is not a great plot', 'essentially a set of cliches recycled', 'there are some serious problems', 'it would be overly familiar']"
"the premise of this movie is , well , pretty far - fetched .
tom berenger plays shale , a mercenary who is temporarily out of work ( those fools at the cia have denied his existence just because he and his buddies botched a job in cuba ) .
fortunately , his girl friend ( diane venora ) , a teacher at christopher columbus high school in miami , gets her knee cap broken by a disgruntled student , creating a job opening for shale as a substitute teacher .
not telling his girl friend , who might object on pedagogical grounds , he creates a number of fake higher degrees for himself ( from yale , harvard , princeton , et al ) and begins his tenure as a high school teacher .
the students ( junkies , drug dealers , gang members , sleazy sluts , ice - pick wielders . . .
you get the picture ) do n't really take to him right away , so he hits one in the face with a can and breaks a few fingers .
this gets their attention to a certain extent , so he tells them the story of the vietnam war : "" see , some homeboys from the north tried to muscle in on the turf of the homeboys from the south .
""
oh yeah , now they can dig it ; the problem is just that nobody ever explained it properly before .
but wait !
there are drugs being dealt in the school itself ! and behind the whole scheme , in cahoots with the head gang , the kod ( no , not "" cod "" , but "" knights of destruction "" . . .
really ! ) , is none other than .
. .
the upright , ex - cop principal , played by the forgotten ghostbuster , ernie hudson !
so shale does what any good teacher would do .
he gets his buddies together , they gather together a bunch of bazookas and other major weapons , explosives , and cool stuff like that , and they have a big showdown against the drug dealers and kod at the high school .
ok , so
the premise is not just far - fetched , it 's downright dumb . if this were a hong kong action comedy , we might just accept it , but it takes itself far too seriously to be truly fun
.
oh , it has its moments ; how one can truly hate a movie in which huge ( really huge ) amounts of cocaine are delivered in school busses ?
and to be fair , it is almost never really boring , as the action is interrupted by only short sequences of actual story .
but over all , this is pretty much a made - for - tv movie with more ( and bigger ) explosions and more foul language .
in fact , it reminded me of "" miami vice "" without the production values , babes in skimpy bikinis , and pastels .
if you can sneak into the theater without paying , go for it .
otherwise , wait for video .
the flying inkpot rating system :
* wait for the tv2 broadcast .

* a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha !

"a month ago i wrote that speed 2 was the worst film i 've ever reviewed on paper .
i did n't know at the time
that i 'd soon encounter and despise batman & robin , which has just overtaken speed 2 as the picture least worthy of your attention this summer . as directed by joel schumacher ( who now specializes in batman sequels and john grisham adaptations and is n't very good at either ) , b & r is
one long excuse for a taco bell promotion .

"matthew broderick and high school comedy .
the two terms have been practically inseparable since ferris buehler took the day off in 1986 .
now it is 13 years later , and broderick has another high school comedy , election , to show the world .
ferris buehler 's day off showed an educational setting that was similar to a pile of marshmallows .
it was light , fluffy , tasty , and sparkling clean .
but election is far different .
this production is a dark , and frighteningly realistic one that does so much more than entertain for the 103 minutes it occupies ; it shocks as well .
jim mcallister ( matthew broderick ) is the type of teacher that makes american high schools proud .
he is a kind , caring , younger man who has built his life around carver high school .
in turn , carver high school has provided a home for him .
jim has won teacher of the year no less than three times in his 12 year span , and is a well respected social studies teacher among the student body .
tracy flick ( reese witherspoon ) is an intelligent , outgoing , and , to quote the film , "" super nice "" young girl .
she is involved in numerous extracurricular activities , always has her hand up first in class , and is extremely popular among most of the student body .
so , it is a natural progression when she decides to run for school president .
the metzler family is an extremely wealthy one .
the father , dick ( holmes osborne ) , owns a cement company .
the mother , jo ( jeanine jackson ) , is an ideal housewife .
and the two children , paul ( chris klein ) and tammy ( jessica campbell ) , are both students at carver high school .
paul was the quarterback of the football team before he injured himself , and is definitely a candidate for most popular person in school .
tammy is a lesbian who , to say the least , is going through a period of self discovery .
for reasons of revenge , hatred , and sexual envy , jim convinces paul to run against tracy for school president .
he claims that in a democracy you need choices , and having tracy run unopposed creates a dictatorship of sorts .
so paul agrees and the race is on .
but then , in an effort to spite the two candidates , tammy announces that she is running as well .
her campaign is straightforward : people only run to put it on their college applications , then they do nothing .
well , "" i do n't even want to go to college , "" she says .
in election , there are no "" good guys "" .
almost everyone has their own agenda .
no matter how deeply hidden , the production digs it up and exploits it for the audience .
tracy is the type of person that you remember from high school .
she is the girl that would be labeled "" most likely to achieve anything she wants "" in the yearbook , and everyone secretly envied her because of that .
jim is a teacher that takes the trust that students give him as a privilege , and uses it to his own amoral advantage .
everyone , including the principal , a former teacher , all the candidates , and even paul 's girlfriend are two sided characters .
that is much of this film 's beauty , it does n't have the typical good guys that hollywood likes , instead it is a realistic portrayal of the real world , specializing in revealing the type of sexual perversions that people usually keep to themselves .
matthew broderick could n't have been any more perfect for this role .
his character is often similar bill murray 's award winning role in the 1998 film , rushmore .
of the two acting jobs , broderick 's is far superior .
but even he is overshadowed by the young reese witherspoon .
the hatred that she causes the audience to develop towards her , is simply indescribable .
broderick and witherspoon are simply at their best when they are playing off each other in various scenes .
one such moment occurs when she approaches him in his car as he is leaving school one day .
you can see her self pride in her eyes as she presents him a list of signatures , making her an eligible candidate .
and his subtle disgust with her is apparent , although he tries to mask it between the lines and attempts to put on a happy face .
the supporting cast is one with little hollywood experience .
but that is far from apparent as everyone takes control of their part .
however , the real treat is jessica campbell in her confused role as a young homosexual girl .
this is never more apparent than the scene where she delivers her speech announcing her so - called platform for presidency .
she is just marvelous as her hatred towards what she thinks to be an unjust system is expressed .
if ferris buehler made you feel good about american high schools , and gave you an innocent laugh or two , then the movie achieved its goal .
but do n't you dare think that election 's goals are similar .
it is just as real in its portrayal of high school , as its characters are in the real world .
there certainly is no pile of marshmallows here .",1,"[""could n't have been any more perfect for this role"", 'is far superior', 'a realistic portrayal', 'simply at their best when they are playing off each other in various scenes', 'she is just marvelous', 'does so much more than entertain', ""that is much of this film 's beauty"", 'that is far from apparent as everyone takes control of their part']"
"once again , the battle is dreamworks versus disney : earlier this year , the mammoth companies fought to the death with their end - of - the - world asteroid flicks , deep impact and armageddon .
here we are now , just a few months later , and they 're at it again with dueling bug movies , antz and a bug 's life .
what i find so astonishing is that both pairs of movies are so inherently similar in both story and execution .
i mean , come on
-- what were the chances of two studios both deciding to bring out computer - animated films about bugs ?
as was the case with the meteor movies , disney has come out on top : though antz is a likable movie , a bug 's life is far superior .
in fact , this movie made me realize what was wrong with antz
: i became immersed in the world of a bug 's life , while antz just made me scrutinize everything .
but it 's not really fair to base an entire review on a comparison .
a bug 's life is a remarkable film in its own right , and deserves to be seen apart from any other computer - animated film about bugs .
in fact , it 's one of the best films this year : it 's smart , subtle , and funny , but it 's also perfect family entertainment and relentlessly entertaining .
i have n't had such a good time at the movies in months .
it tells the story of an ant named flick ( voice by dave foley ) ; he 's a nice guy , but he 's also a troublemaker .
the ants spend all season putting together the offering , a big pile of food that they provide for the grasshoppers .
just before the grasshoppers come , flick accidentally knocks over the offering , and ruins everything for the entire colony : the grasshopper 's leader , hopper ( kevin spacey ) , is enraged , and tells them that the ants need twice the food by the end of summer , or they 're all dead .
flick , feeling responsible for this , sets off to look for help -- he realizes that the only way to be rid of the grasshoppers is to fight them .
he heads to the city ( the city being a house a few miles away ) , where he finds a colorful bunch of circus bugs : a ladybug ( denis leary , who is spectacular ) , a black widow ( bonnie hunt ) , a caterpillar ( joe ranft ) , a butterfly ( madeline kahn ) , a rhinoceros beetle ( michael mcshane ) , and a stick ( david hyde - pierce , also giving a hilarious performance ) .
flick does n't know they 're actors , and they do n't know that flick needs them to kill a bunch of grasshoppers , so they return to the colony with flick and find themselves in an unusual position .
the most obvious element of a bug 's life is the quality of animation .
created by pixar ,
the same people who brought us toy story , a bug 's life has some of the most amazing visuals i 've ever seen .
the bugs seem to inhabit a three - dimensional space , and occasionally there will be a shot that is indistinguishable from live action .
this is a lush , colorful world , full of life and imagination : the way the animators insert the things all of us see in our daily lives ( matches , bottlecaps , tin cans , etc . ) and make them active objects in the bugs ' world is innovative .
the film is also mercilessly exciting , particularly in a superbly - staged scene involving our heroes ' escape from a bird ( a little bird never seemed so huge and threatening ) .
but the makers of a bug 's life know where the importance lies : story and characters .
flick , with solid voice work from foley , is a great guy to lead the story .
but the real treat comes with the circus bugs ; they 're such a likable group of characters -- the standouts are the stick ( hyde - pierce is so good ) , francis the ladybug , and the big fat caterpillar .
all of these bugs have more than a token personality , which makes the suspenseful scenes work because we care about the bugs , and it also keeps the tear - jerking scenes from seeming obligatory .
in my review of antz , i said that the film is a clever cop - out because it presents a bunch of little humans reacting to an ant - like existence .
in concept , a bug 's life is basically the same movie , except that i was never given enough time to find things that i did n't like about it .

"director jan de bont certainly knows how to make top quality action films .
you need look no further than die hard ( he was director of photography ) , speed and last years twister for examples of his hi- octane , edge of your seat thrill prowess .

the reason for this act of destruction is revenge .
after years of working for the company that builds cruise liner computers , he contracts copper poisoning and is retired .
naturally , what entails next is a lot of running / jumping about and general high quality action as jason patrick does his level best to save the day .

"i remember seeing the trailer of the black cauldron on the pinocchio video .
it really scared me , and i did n't want to go see it .
however , after i heard about how wonderful it was , i wanted to see it .
i did n't get a chance to do so , until now .
the film , disney 's 25th animated feature , opens with a menacing shot of a great black cauldron unshrouded by mist as a narrator begins to tell the tale : a long time ago in the land of prydain , there was a king so evil , that his spirit was captured in the cauldron .
it has been hidden for centuries , and whoever possesses it will have the power to conjure up an army of deathless warriors , and with them rule the world ? and destroy it .
then , we meet a farmer - wizard , dallben , and his young apprentice , taran .
taran dreams of being a warrior instead of being a ` pig - keeper '
( they have a pig named hen - wen ) .
one day , as he gives hen wen a nice warm bath , the pig goes crazy , and dallben then realizes , after watching hen wen 's thoughts through a bucket of water , that taran must hide hen wen in the forest .
an evil ruler known as the horned king is searching for the black cauldron , and only hen wen has the power to show its location .
taran leads hen wen into the forest , but of course , he loses her , and tries to go find her . along the way , he meets up with a mischievous little creature named gurgi , who desires ` munchings and crunchings ' , much to his dismay ( besides , he stole an apple that taran was trying to use to bring back hen wen ) .
when he hears hen wen 's squeal from far away , though , he races to her rescue ?
only to see her get kidnapped by dragonlike gwythants .
taran chases after the gwythants and finds himself staring at the horned king 's castle from far away .
taran climbs the castle walls , and brings himself into the castle , where he attempts to rescue hen wen .
he manages to do so , but he is himself captured and thrown into the dungeon .
there , he meets princess eilonwy ( and her magic bauble , another thing which the horned king was hoping to use to find the cauldron ) , and the two escape through the deep castle walls .
along the way , taran finds a sword in a burial chamber , and they rescue a comic bard named fflewdurr flamm , who has a harp whose strings break whenever he tells a lie .
the three manage to escape the horned king 's castle , but not before taran realizes that his sword is magic .
as they rest in the forest , gurgi reappears , claiming to have found hen wen 's trail .
he leads taran , eilonwy and fflewdurr , by way of ` pig tracks ' , to a whirlpool .
suddenly , they all get sucked under , and they meet the fairy - like fairfolk .
taran is reunited with hen wen , and informed that the black cauldron is hidden in the land of morva .
he then devises a crazy idea that if they can destroy the cauldron , it would prevent the horned king from destroying their world .
with the help of a grumpy fairy named doli , the four travelers manage to find themselves at a mysterious cottage .
it turns out to be no ordinary cottage ; three comically strange witches inhabit the place .
when taran tells them that they are searching for the black cauldron , they agree to let him have it ?
in exchange for his sword .
taran agrees , much to eilonwy 's horror , but at least they get the black cauldron .
but ?
the cauldron ca n't be destroyed , only its evil powers can be stopped .
the only way to do so is for a living being to climb into it of his own free will ? never to return alive .
things take a turn for the worse when the horned king 's henchmen capture taran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr , along with the black cauldron , and lead them back to the castle .
taran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr watch in horror as the horned king unleashes the supernatural powers of the cauldron to ressurect his army of deathless warriors ( this is the most horrifying scene in the film , because here , a dead army comes alive ? ) .
just when all seems lost , though , gurgi reappears , and rescues taran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr .
taran is about to jump into the black cauldron , but gurgi stops him , not wanting him to throw his life away .
gurgi then jumps into the black cauldron , and the deathless warriors decay .
taran tries to find a way to rescue gurgi , but he is forced to do battle against the horned king .
he kicks the horned king away , who is then magically sucked into the black cauldron , where its powers immediately destroy him completely .
taran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr manage to escape from the horned king 's castle just as it self - destructs .
the witches then reappear and attempt to take the now useless black cauldron away , but fflewdurr stops them , saying that they ` never give anything away , they bargain ' .
in response to this , the witches offer taran his sword back , but taran instead has a new trade : the cauldron for gurgi .
the trade is made ; gurgi 's seemingly lifeless body reappears before the heartbroken group .
as taran cradles him in his arms , though , gurgi stirs - he is not dead after all !
the happy group then returns home , where hen wen ( brought home by the fairfolk once the dangers are past ) , dallben , and even doli , await their triumphant return . as spectacular as it sounds , the black cauldron really suffered a lot in its past times .
before ron miller was fired from his position as chairman of walt disney productions , he had bought a novel by lloyd alexander called the black cauldron , a sword and sorcery tale for the studio .
bringing this book to the screen was the studio 's fondest dream .
miller , who entitled himself as the executive producer , promised that they would do so after they had proved themselves on other projects .
when micheal eisner and his executives arrived at the disney animation studio , the animators were struggling to complete the black cauldron .
by this time , things had gone really rocky for the animation department .
many of the studio 's old men had retired or died .
therefore , the animators suffered a hard time making this film .
originally budgeted at $ 25 million , the costs raised to $ 40 million because of constant changes on everything ?
and when it was finally released on june 24 , 1985 , the black cauldron was greeted by praising reviews from some critics , but somehow the film flopped .
the film was rated pg and the film , although ` disneyfied ' from lloyd alexander 's chronicles of prydain ( which is what this film is based on ) , was much more scarier and darker than disney 's other previous efforts , such as the rescuers and the fox and the hound , which is probably why so many people considered it too scary and stayed away from it .
in addition , other critics rejected it for having ` no heart ' and ` unmemorable ' , compared to other disney animated features .
but whatever the real reason , the black cauldron was a financial disaster , grossing only $ 21 million .
the failure of the film grounded the studio 's animation department , and exiled the animation team to annex buildings in nearby glendale , and it seemed like animated features would no longer become a part of the studio 's reputation .
the next two disney animated features , the great mouse detective and oliver and company , although a little more lighthearted than the black cauldron , did n't do much better ( although oliver and company grossed much more than the black cauldron and the great mouse detective ) .
only with the little mermaid did the studio regain its reputation for successful animated features .
as for the black cauldron , it was rereleased in some cities for a temporary time under the title taran and the magic cauldron .
finally , the studio locked the film in the film vault and denied that it ever even was released . because of all this , you might ask yourself , was the black cauldron really such a bad movie ?
the people who had seen the film did n't think so .
in fact , many people had calls to buena vista home video requesting for the film , but of course , they denied it .
for a while , it seemed like the black cauldron would never be released to video ? until september 1997 , disney released the black cauldron to video in the united kingdom .
few people imported the video from england and converted to ntsc ( including me ) and for those who had n't seen the film yet ( i am included here ) ,
they got quite a treat .
but people who had bootleg copies of the black cauldron noticed that in the scene where the horned king raises his army of deathless warriors , about 12 seconds of ghoulish looking skeletons were slightly trimmed so that the film would get a u rating ( in the uk , the u rating means universal : suitable for all ages , kinda like their own version of g ) .
somewhere online , a team of diehard the black cauldron fans signed a petition that said , ` bring back the black cauldron ! ' , and because of that , disney finally decided to release the video to the united states .
before that time , rumors online had been made that the video would be trimmed , like the uk video , so that it would get a g rating , and that they would add in songs .
those rumors were put to rest when the walt disney company announced that the black cauldron * would * be released in its pg rated version .
even still , when it was finally released to the us , some reaction was mixed .
some felt that it was indeed cut , but some felt that it was n't .
but these where only minor criticisms which seemed laughable , since a film that was absent for thirteen years was finally available .
as for myself , when i saw the movie for the first time ( on converted ntsc video ) , i did n't expect much at all .
in fact , i had heard so many mediocre things about it , that i did n't think the film would ever be such a good film .
much to my surprise , when i saw the first few minutes of the film , i was asking myself , "" this is the same film everyone saw ?
the one that flopped at the box office ?
the one that critics and filmgoers alike called "" a bad movie "" ?
this does n't seem like all of the above . instead ,
it 's a classic in its own right .
the film has a wonderful cast of characters .
there 's taran ( grant bardsley ) , an assistant pig keeper who would rather be a warrior than a pig - keeper , the story 's hero .
the critics have said that taran is not likeable at all , but the opposite is true .
he is brave , loyal , and eventually learns a lesson about friendship later on .
there 's a likeable character here !
not that he 's the only likeable character in the film .
there 's gurgi ( john biner ) , a lovable little , uh , thing who remains loyal to taran , even though they do n't quite hit it off at first .
but another likeable character is the bad guy comic henchman , a dwarf named creeper ( phil fondacairo ) , who is loyal to the film 's imaginative and sinister villain , the horned king ( voiced gruesomely by john hurt ) , yet he also fears his neck .
the other characters , including the sidekicks , a spunky , but sweet princess named eilonwy and the comic bard fflewdurr flamm , and three comically wicked witches who hide a dark secret , although pleasant and likeable , are n't quite as well rounded as they should be .
the story itself is an adventurous one , a quest involving the mystical pig , hen wen , the black cauldron itself , and an army of deathless ones with everything : a hooking opening to a spectacular finale .
elmer bernstein 's music also tells the story perfectly , in a dark , yet calming manner .
the animation itself is surprisingly good considering that this film was created in the darkest time of the studios .
even though there are some occasional effects that are not quite good , like the ground opening when the black cauldron rises out of the earth , the animation overall is top notch .
overall ?
this film is an entertaining endeavor .
fans unfamiliar to the lloyd alexander chronicles of prydain will get a kick out of this one , except young kids .
there are some extremely scary scenes which are more darker than disney 's other films ( although some consider the stampede sequence from the lion king and frollo observing esmeralda in the fires of hell in the hunchback of notre dame are just as scary ) , which is the main reason why this film is rated pg .
fans familiar to the lloyd alexander series will recognize the differences between the novel and the movie .
even though it does n't have all of the ingredients of a true disney film , this film is a classic in its own right , and deserves a far better chance than what it has been given .
that better chance has finally come .
whatever reason about why the black cauldron was such a big failure seems to have disappeared , and the film has finally achieved its place among disney 's most proudest achievements .
i ca n't help but think though , whatever would have happened if the black cauldron * was * a box office success ?",1,"['a classic in its own right', 'the animation overall is top notch', 'a wonderful cast of characters', 'an entertaining endeavor', 'they got quite a treat', 'surprisingly good', ""it 's a classic in its own right""]"

"since most movies about slavery shield us from the true horrors of what they 're portraying , it 's fitting to say that "" beloved "" come as a real shock as a film .
it 's confusing , bizarre , and as tough a film to watch as any film i 've seen all year , and that 's not necessarily because of the three - hour running time .
"" beloved "" is challenging to watch , filled with tough and powerful poetry
that takes us completely off guard , and instead of a straight - forward , hollywood - ized story about what happened to the slaves after they were freed , "" beloved "" comes off as a cry of anguish from all those who actually lived through what happened ( or , rather , toni morrison , who wrote the novel upon which this is based ) .
"" beloved "" tells the story of an ex - slave named sethe , played by oprah winfrey , who lives on a large farm in the north with her children .
when the film opens , her house is being terrorized by a poltergeist , which shakes things up , wounds the dog , and makes things generally uncomfortable for the family .
sethe is proud , though , and will not move .
her sons run away , leaving only her and her daughter , denver ( kimberly elise ) alone with the ghost which is there without any factual explanation .
a couple years pass , and the ghost remains , and one day , a man named paul d ( danny glover ) , another ex - slave who knew sethe years ago when they worked on a plantation together , arrives , asking for lodging .
he has been wandering around since he left the plantation , and when he enters the house , it turns red and becomes incredibly hot .
when he remarks about what he thinks is evil , sethe replies "" it ai n't evil .
it 's just sad .
""
some more time passes , and paul d has become a fervent member of the household , and the ghost disappears .
but when they return one day from going out , they discover a young woman sitting in the house .
her name is beloved , and as played by thandie newton , she has almost zero motor skills .
she stumbles around , half - grabbing onto things and knocking them over , and when she speaks , she lets out a low guttural sound that eventually turns into baby talk .
they let her into her house , and she begins to turn things upside down .
"" beloved "" acts like an incredibly difficult chamber drama paired with a ghost story .
most of the scenes consist of people arguing in one claustrophobic , low - lit room , with the occasional flash to the past , where we see images of such horror that we thank god for modern - day psychoanalysts .
sethe and paul d have lived through such hellish times that they are forever implanted with the memories of their slavehood on the old plantation , which includes such images as sethe being raped by the white plantation hands , with her nipples being licked , prompting her to cry out to paul d when reminiscing about it , "" they took my milk !
"" worst of all was the month after her freedom , when she was allowed to live like a free person , working with other blacks on a farm , and then seeing that her old plantation owners have arrived to presumedly take her and her children back .
she runs to the barn near by , carrying her four children , and when her old owners burst in , they discover she has murdered one of them and is ready to murder the rest of them if they do n't leave them alone .
when she is inquired about this moment by paul d in a moment halfway through the film , she says she does n't regret it .
she killed her daughter so that she would not have to live through the horror she did , and she has convinced herself she did the right thing .
of course , beloved is really her daugher materialized , though we are n't flat out
told that until later on in the film .
beloved represents the pain and suffering the slaves went through and shows how difficult it was for them to deal with their freedom after being tortured for so long .
thus , "" beloved "" becomes
a sorta - redux of the andrei tarkofsky sci - fi classic , "" solaris , "" where a cosmonaut discovers that his wife , who commited suicide years before , has materialized when he is orbiting over a planet with a complex brain system .
that film spoke volumes about humanity and our memories , how we are constantly regretting what happened in the past , and when if it ever literally came back to haunt us , it would control us completely .
"" beloved "" moves along freely , without a lot of explanation , and
for the most part , this is extremely respectable .
the most interesting films are the ones that do n't explain everything for us , leaving gaps in the characters that we are supposed to fill in with how they act in the present tense .
sethe is never fully explained as a character , but we understand all her actions since she 's being played by oprah winfrey .
it 's been well over a decade since her last major performance in "" the color purple , "" but judging from these two films , i 'll bet she 's one of the best actresses working today
.
. . if she was strictly an actress .
her talk show , which i suppose is a great entity , has prevented her from becoming a noteworthy actress , and that 's a shame because she brings so much to this movie .
emotion .
sadness .
strength .
watching the strong sethe , who 's so afraid of the past that she 's built a rather strong protective coating around herself , break down when she discovers who beloved really is is what makes this movie really great .
she makes it real .
that 's not to say this is a perfect film .
in fact , i 'd wager to say that the fact that it 's confusing and painful to watch is what prevents this from being the truly great film it is .
while oprah 's performance is powerful and easily sympathetic
( and i 'm dying to see her win at least an oscar nomination
this february ) , the structure of the film , which does n't show what happened to her children till halfway through the film , prevents us from really making a cohesive connection to the film .
it does n't necessarily move as though they 're memories of one particular character , and by the end , it has lost control over sethe , and as she takes to bed , we are unable to truly identify with her anymore .
but despite its tediousness , perhaps that 's the point .
the distancing by the end of the film may be just part of the way it has been built from the start , since they figure she has crossed over from being identifiable , and it needs to get back with reality .
and for the most part , this film seems like the cry of pain from the slaves that it really wants to be .
jonathan demme 's direction is bizarre , in nature with the story , and he creates the right mood , making it a tough film to sit through , making sure that the audience feels as uncomfortable as the characters .
there 's more to admire here , like the way that the flashbacks pop up freely and without real organization , just like they would be in real life ; and the way that the ending leaves it somewhat open to more pain and suffering , but laced with a touch of optimism .
the acting , not only from winfrey , is amazing , and i anticipate not only she will get an oscar nomination .
everyone has been raving about thandie newton 's performance , and how it should be rewarded .
however , it must be noted that out of everyone , she had the easiest part .
act like a baby .
throw things .
stumble around .
chew food with your mouth open .
i do think there 's another performance worthy of oscar conisderation , but it 's kimberly elise , as the daugher who has to stay sensible and sane , and has to carry the burden of her mother 's loss of reality towards the end .
it 's not that newton is n't great : she 's as annoying and wacky as the role demands .
it 's just that elise has the tougher job and pulls it off even better .
despite the fact that this film has winfrey written all over it , and not that of writer morrison or director demme , "" beloved "" has still not done well .
costing , i think , around ninety million dollars , it has since grossed about twenty - two .
unfortunately , this film is a little too intense for viewers , even for me , and i can stand almost anything
( i recently viewed the 2 1/2 hour long epic "" caligula , "" the worst film i have ever seen in my life , and did it in a mere 2 sittings ) .
although i respect "" beloved , "" i ca n't say that i really enjoyed it .",1,"['tough and powerful poetry', ""she 's one of the best actresses working today"", 'win at least an oscar nomination', 'she brings so much to this movie', 'amazing', ""there 's more to admire here"", 'powerful and easily sympathetic']"
"there are certain people in the world who have some talent that very few people have , but they chose not to take advantage of this for some personal reason .
""
good will hunting "" is about one of those people .
the will hunting of the ( horrible ) title ( let 's face it
, this film would be a bitch to title ) , played by co - writer matt damon , is a mathematical genius .
he can do almost any mathematical connundrum in about the time it takes to brew a cup of irish cream cappuccino .
and he works at mit . . .
as the janitor .
one day , the professor of one of the most challenging courses , proffessor lambeau ( "" breaking the waves "" 's stellan skarsg ?
rd ) , puts a big problem on the board for his students to attempt to complete .
the next day , it 's already done on the board , but no one in his class claims to have done it .
so lambeau puts another problem on the board , this time one that took he and his colleagues over two years to prove .
and , duh , it 's done again .
of course , they catch the guy who did it red handed - will .
before lambeau can find will again ( he ran away when he caught him ) , will has gotten into a fight with a bunch of punks on a basketball court , and struck a police officer , so lambeau gets him out on probation with two agreements : a ) he work with him on math , and b ) he get some therapy .
after going through some therapists whom he psyches out in one way or another ( for a hypnotist , he fakes being under his spell , then launches into an impromptu performance of the 70s classic , "" afternoon delight "" ) .
finally , lambeau 's old college roomate , sean mcguire ( robin williams ) , a psych professor , agrees to treat him , and the two begin a rocky relationship , as sean tries to get will to open up .
turns out will had a rough childhood , being abandoned , and placed in foster homes and what not .
it also turns out that will does not want to do simple mathematics all his life ; he wants a challenge .
and that is to hang out with his buds ( including the other co - writer , ben affleck ) , and do honorable jobs , like construction .
is it right to make this genius follow in the footsteps of einstein and kasinsky ?
should this guy be forced to do something he does n't want to do ?
this appears to be one of the million questions in this film , which is jam - packed with greatness , but does not have the totally brilliant whole it should .
i 'm not saying "" good will hunting "" is a bad film at all .
it 's a very enjoyable film with tons of great moments , and lots of great things about it .
the acting is amazing , with two oscar - nomination - worthy performances from damon and williams , who have amazing chemistry together .
we also get some great support from stellan skarsg ?
rd ( great name ) , ben affleck , and from minnie driver , who plays will 's love interest , skylar .
there are tons of individual moments that i adored .
i loved all the comedy in the film , especially a scene where damon proves a schmuck out of a college student who is quoting a historian to impress some chicks , his various attempts at therapy , and of course , my favorite scene in the entire film , the one where he delivers a long , exstensive rant to some nsa agents about the downside of working for them .
i liked the relationship between some of the people , like will and skylar , will and sean , sean and lambeau , and will and his friends .
there are scenes between them which are just amazing to watch .
and there are even moments in the film which are so honest in their portrayal , that i felt rightfully uncomfortable .
like the break - up scene between will and skylar , will and sean 's first meeting , a bar scene between sean and lambeau , and a scene where sean tells in detail how he does n't regret meeting his first wife , who would later suffer a slow , painful death , and leave him lonely and slightly bitter .
however , the main flaw of the film is there 's too much of everything , and not enough of it either .
the film tries for deeper relations between the characters , but they 're sometimes either overwritten or underwritten .
take for example the relationship between sean and will : the film gets an interesting father / son as well as doctor / patient relationship going with out any problems , but when it tries to show them as equals , it falls on its face .
we hear how they went to the same town , and there are even scenes where the film shows how hypocritical both of them are at times .
but this never takes off like the other parts of their relationship do .
also , will 's relationship with his best friend , chuckie ( affleck ) , has a nice climax , but not enough rising action .
we see them joking around , but when chuckie arrives at a decision between the two of them , it seems more like a superficial reasoning than a more selected one .
their relationship never goes beyond "" just best friends , "" and his decision just seems to be a generalization of any two best friends instead of something more . . .
human .
maybe it was just me .
and it also goes for a parallelism with the relationship between sean and lambeau , but that , again , is underwritten .
and , of course , as in most films like this , the girl / boy relationship is pretty underwritten .
we never understand what they see in each other , so when skylar confesses that she loves him , it seems more like it 's there for plot details that anything else .
minnie driver is interesting , though , and breathes life into her character .
the writing is a bit at fault here , but what makes all this worthwhile is the little moments in the film where it acheives true awesomeness
.
sure , it feels overstuffed , but it 's extremely enjoyable .
the dialogue that affleck and damon have written is amazingly fresh , and seems extremely human .
i think that they should get a nomination for their script chiefly because of the dialogue , which is amazing .
while this is probably director gus van sant 's most conservative film ( you 'd hardly know it 's the same director of "" to die for , "" the only van sant film i 've seen , really )
, it 's still a pretty remarkable film , albeit a tad overrated ( what 's this "" best picture "" deal ? ) .
and if a film puts a smile on my face despite posessing a lot of flaws , i have no problem with reccomending it to anyone .",1,"['a very enjoyable film with tons of great moments', 'a pretty remarkable film', 'amazingly fresh', 'where it acheives true awesomeness', 'just amazing to watch', 'the acting is amazing , with two oscar - nomination - worthy performances', 'extremely enjoyable', 'have amazing chemistry together', 'jam - packed with greatness', 'great things']"
"after bloody clashes and independence won , lumumba refused to pander to the belgians , who continued a condescending and paternalistic relationship with the congo .
their officers , particularly general janssens ( rudi delhem ) in the force publique , the congo 's army , caused rebellions , undermining lumumba , who was outraged at the rape and murder of belgian nationals .
with unrest building , moise tshombe ( pascal nzonzi ) and the province of katanga , which contained 70 percent of the country 's resources , proclaimed secession .

peck 's script illuminates bantu sayings like ' the hand that gives , rules ' when lumumba uses it with the american ambassador .
peck 's direction is less assured , with many scenes unfortunately playing like standard television fare .
he 's served well , though , by his casting of ebouaney in the title role .
ebouaney is dynamic , radiating his character 's fierce passion for his people and his country .
lumumba 's intelligence and ability to strategize , even as he 's cornered by insurmountable odds , are given life by ebouaney .

"take two old and dying men , a lifetime of regrets , a house full of sins , a thoroughly despicable man , enough lies , insecurities and other character defects to keep a team of psychiatrists gainfully employed , then add a inexplicable meteorological and amphibian - based phenomenon and you will have summed up magnolia , the newest film from paul thomas anderson ( boogie nights ) .
the movie tells multiple stories , weaving them together , or overlapping them during the course of its three hour running time .
would that the stories were worth the telling .
earl partridge ( jason robards , a thousand acres ) is dying of cancer .
bedridden , in much pain , it is obvious that his time is growing short .
his much younger wife played by julianne moore ( an ideal husband ) is surprised to find herself struggling with his impending death .
having married for money , she discovers that she has actually fallen in love with the old guy and regrets having cheated and lied .
earl regrets having cheated on his first wife and estranging himself from his only son ( tom cruise , eyes wide shut ) , now a misogynist self - help guru who teaches men how to "" seduce and destroy , "" his sexual and vulgar perspective on male / female relationships is so over - the - top as to be utterly unbelievable .
meanwhile , jimmy gator ( philip baker hall , the insider ) is also dying of cancer .
not as physically incapacitated as earl , jimmy is still able to perform his duties as the lovable host of a long - running quiz show which pits adults against children .
the current whiz - quiz - kid is stanley spector ( jeremy blackman in his film debut ) who is tired of the pressure of performing and is willing to call it quits .
on the other hand , quiz kid donnie smith ( william macy , mystery men ) would like nothing more than to return to the spotlight when he was a "" somebody .
""
his pathetic life is souring as he can no longer capitalize on his brief 15 minutes of fame which stanley is all too eager to relinquish .
jimmy has his own family crisis as his drug - addict daughter ( melora walters , boogie nights ) refuses to have anything to do with him for reasons which are not disclosed to us until the end of the film .
grabbing at one last attempt at happiness she reaches out to a softhearted cop ( john c .
reilly , never been kissed ) even as she tries to push herself away from him because she deems herself not worthy of his affection .
this dysfunctional group carries on for what seems to be an interminable two - thirds of the movie .
and then it gets worse , literally raining frogs .
yes , frogs . assuming it to be an intended deus - ex - machina device ,
it is an ineffective one because it does n't seem to faze the characters much .
oh , they may step gingerly around the splattered frog corpses littering the streets , but otherwise , the frog shower did n't seem to change their behavior or pattern of living ( or dying ) .
there is simply too much going on in this movie and most of it is distasteful to watch .
mr .
anderson further obscures the film by incorporating a loud and intrusive sound track that often drowned out the dialogue , a character who apparently rapped a significant clue to a plot development which was completely unintelligble , and a heavy handed segment of "" historical "" occurances containing ironic twists which set up absolutely nothing .
one of the recurring themes is found in a line donnie quotes : "" we may be done with the past , but the past is not done with us .
""
this is an absolute lie .
god is in the forgiveness business .
in fact , as we humbly ask for forgiveness and repent or change our offending mindset , god 's word says that he not only forgives , he also forgets .

"this movie tries to present itself as the sequel to jan de bont 's debut as a director , 1994 surprise hit speed .
but the only thing the two movies have in common is sandra bullock as the female lead .
annie ( sandra bullock ) is in the wrong place at the wrong time again .
she 's going on a cruise with her new boy - friend alex ( jason patric ) , and of course it is her ship that is kidnapped by john geiger ( willem dafoe ) who has a bone to pick with the shipping line .
they sacked him after he got sick .
now he wants the diamonds stored in the ship 's safe for compensation .
that actually is the whole storyline .
speed 2 could do without dialogues .
the movie is all about images and remarkable sound .
i do n't really know why this is called an action movie . except for a few scenes that are vaguely reminiscent of speed this goes along the lines of the desaster movies of the 70ies .
first we are introduced to a number of people who are going to be important later on in the movie .
then desaster strikes .
sandra bullock was said to have been glad that she could take action this time around .
i looked for the "" action "" but could n't find it .
most of the time she is part of the decoration .
the only time she is part of what happens is when she can have a shot at defusing a bomb and freeing some passengers trapped behind a fire door .
now we know that she can handle a chain saw .
we also know that fire doors on cruise ships can be cut apart in seconds .
the bomb defusal of course goes wrong , but only the furniture is damaged , not our heroes who still are needed .
jason patric alias alex spends most of his time flirting with annie , helping other passengers and frolicking in the water .
his initial sea - sickness is suddenly gone , because there are ship , crew and passengers to be saved from evil geiger .
he does a pretty good job but
i ca n't blame keanu reeves for declining this part .
then there 's willem dafoe , the villain , who desperately tries to look as frightening as frankenstein 's monster .
he does n't succeed , though .
an untidy appearance is n't enough to convince the viewer of his psychopath potential . before he tries again to make us believe he is a dangerous man
he should practise for a while in front of a mirror .
i ca n't really recommend speed 2 .
you will probably like the movie if you like funny situations that are n't meant to be funny .
especially the showdown , when the ship first runs into an oil tanker and then dissembles a whole village is a treat .
there you get to see the most superfluous scene in the movie .
in keeping with last year 's desaster movie tradition a dog is miraculously saved from certain death .
a really funny ( and meant to be funny ) scene takes place on the oil tanker right before the collision .
some crew members watch two ships colliding in an old movie .
had they looked out the window they would n't have missed the huge ship racing toward them .
those of you who still want to see the movie should pick a theater with a large screen and a good sound system to enjoy the visual effects and the phantastic surround sound effects .
in an adequately equipped theater it 's as if the explosion were going off all around you
and you can feel the seats vibrate .

"larry flynt is a self proclaimed smut pedlar and the owner / publisher of the multi - million dollar hustler publications company .
the people vs .
larry flynt is the story of larry flynt 's fight for the freedom to circulate and sell his pornographic magazine , hustler .
based on a true story , the film is almost a documentary in that it 's a very vivid and detailed look at larry flynt 's life .
woody harrelson gives an excellent performance .
he conveys flynt 's peculiarities and his character with depth and focus .
by the end of the film the audience actually finds themselves , somewhat grudgingly , liking larry flynt .
this is some feat given flynt 's apparent lack of any morals or ethics and his extremely smutty and childish behaviour in court .
however , flynt has a number of things going for him , he 's rich , he 's funny , and most importantly , he says exactly what he means .
larry flynt 's wife , althea leasure is played by courtney love .
larry meets althea at one of his clubs , and they fall in love ( a very sexual and open love ) .
both of them indulge in a world of too much sex , and eventually too much drugs .
flynt had been taking an excessive amount of pain killers after being paralysed from the waist down ( which was especially upsetting for him ) by an assassin .
althea had joined him in taking the drugs .
following an operation flynt decides to stop taking drugs , althea does not have any such plans , nor the determination to follow them .
as the film progresses we see her become increasingly frail and sick .
courtney love obviously has a great understanding for althea 's situation , as
she is brilliant in portraying althea in every respect .
it 's extremely sad to watch althea literally wither away .
edward norton plays flynt 's lawyer , alan isaacman .
again , this is a solid performance .
the audience finds it easy to sympathise with isaacman who somehow puts up with flynt 's courtroom antics .
flynt is not only childish in the courtroom , but downright rude to the judges , and lands himself in a lot of trouble ( and even in a mental institution ) because of it .
isaacman is very easy to like , and great at proving ( in quite clever ways )
his points to the court .
milos forman has done a great job in directing
the people vs .
larry flynt .
it is not really an exciting or thrilling film , but instead a highly interesting portrayal of a true story .
due to larry 's character it is also , at times , a very funny film .
however , it is much more than that .
it is about the fight for freedom of speech , anti - censorship , and the right to be able choose for oneself what to see and buy .
an excellent look at flynt , his life , and his story .

i 'm beginning to get fed up .
over my four years as a critic , the thing which has kept me going is the moderate balance of films .
the good balances the bad .
i try to see both in equal proportions .
but disney 's mighty joe young remake marks the fourth week in which i have n't seen a truly terrible movie .
it 's a backwards machismo , i suppose , the urge to see the things which you so loathe ; but i need to see a bad film every once in a while .
and , you know what , mighty joe young does n't qualify .
far from being bad , mighty joe young is actually a family fun movie .
it 's enjoyable , appropriate , cute , cuddly , and all of those other things that i 've been seeing in every movie since a bug 's life .

okay .
a little unrealistic , but who ever said a kid 's movie had to have the slightest hint of realism .
the first half of the movie is a gorillas in the mist - esque hatred of poachers woman - of - the - wild motif .
the second half is a straight up parody of king kong , awestruck onlookers and all .

it is , as a point of fact , an extremely un - creative movie .

"there is a rule when it comes to movies .
a sequel is never as good as the original .
there are very few exceptions to this rule , and texas chainsaw massacre : the next generation is not one of them .
now if you also take into consideration that the original chainsaw massacre was a really bad movie , and that this is n't even the first sequel to it ,
you have a recipe for a very painful viewing experience .
do n't be fooled by the presence of up and coming talents
matthew mcconaughey ( a time to kill ) and renee zellweger ( jerry maguire ) .
they made this movie before they were stars .
judging by their performances they also made it before they took any acting lessons .
it 's a wonder they ever worked in hollywood again after appearing in this turkey .
apparently the producers of this film realized just how bad it was , because it sat unreleased for years until someone decided that they might be able to capitalize off the success of mcconaughey and zellweger .
apparently the two young stars were none too happy about this thing ever seeing the light of day .
and i do n't blame them , they would have been better off if this had been some sort of porno flick starring the two of them .
unfortunately for them
it is a horror film in which zellweger plays your typically stupid horror film character . while mcconaughey plays a guy who wears a mechanical brace on his leg that he controls with a television remote control .
( hey , do n't say i did n't warn you . ) to make matters worse
, leatherface , the chainsaw wielding maniac , who was never the scariest of psychopathic killers at the best of times , has now become a full blown cross - dresser , and spends the entire movie in drag .
there is a plot to this movie but
it is n't worth mentioning .
let 's just suffice to say that a group of teenagers are in the typical wrong place at the wrong time and are left to the mercy of remote control man ( mcconaughey ) and his lipstick wearing chainsaw revving half - witted sidekick .
man , i ca n't get over just how bad this movie is .
this film has absolutely no redeeming qualities .
even the obligatory topless babe shot was n't enough to hold my interest for more than 2 seconds .
the writing is bad , the direction is even worse , but both of those things look good in comparison to the acting .

"possibly the years the most anticipated film and finally it arrives here in the uk .
it smashed u . s box office office records in it 's opening weekend and will no doubt do the same here .
but is it any good ?
in a word ,
no .
i 'll elaborate further .
the story is as follows .
apparently there were two islands with dinosaurs on .
one where the dinos lived untouched by mankind and the other a tourist attraction which failed before it even opened .
( see jurrasic park . )
imgen , the company that funded jurrasic park , want to reccover their losses by taking more dinos off the other island and move them to a new attraction in san diago .
realizing what a bad idea this is , proffessor john hammond ( richard attenborough ) decides to send a team to document the dinosaurs , so as to rally public support to preserve the island .
enter familiar mumbling man jeff goldblum who only agrees to go when told his girlfriend is already there .
so , basically , what you have is this .
two teams , one sent to catch and move some dinosaurs to the mainland and the other , trying to document them , being forced to work together , fighting for survival against the dinosaurs ' firm intentions on eating them .
a fairly good idea , however
it 's let down by one slight problem .
it 's crap .
over two hours of chase scenes gets way too boring , way too quiclky . add to this a terrible script and some feeble attempts at some occasional characterisation
and you end up very disinterested .
it becomes background noise while your mind starts concentrating on things like , ' what 's for tea ? '
and ' should you cut the lawn later ? '
( yes , you should ) .
it 's a shame
then really , that spielberg has lowered himself into making what essentially is a blatant cash in , which adds practically nothing to the far superior jurrasic park .
with only a few creative and genuinely tense scenes and fabulous c .
g .
i dinosaurs
( the t . rex 's have to be seen to be believed ) , there is nothing else to recommend the lost world .

"the obvious reason for producing a sequel to an immensely popular movie is to acquire continued profits .
the rationale is sound , but in many cases of this and recent years , the sequel is a shoddy product that 's exposed for the cash - milking vehicle it really is .
last year 's speed 2 and scream 2 , as well as
this year 's species ii have all been products that have been decisively less than satisfactory .
in some cases , a sequel can even discredit its predecessor , as with the latest neo - slasher flick , i still know what you did last summer .
whatever uniqueness the original might 've had now seems trite and overplayed when paired with this abominable thriller .
julie james ( jennifer love hewitt ) and ray bronson ( freddie prinze jr . ) are back from the original to star in i still know , reprising their roles in typical fashion .
julie and ray experience a rather predictable falling - out at the beginning of the movie , leaving the door wide open for newcomer will benson ( matthew settle ) .
will and julie hit it off , and along with friends karla ( brandy norwood ) and tyrell ( mekhi phifer ) , the foursome heads off to a radio station - giveaway vacation in the tropics .
unfortunately , things are n't so peachy once they arrive , and with a regularity you could set your watch by , the infamous fisherman ( muse watson ) is back with his hook .
it 's another bloody showdown , complete with cliffhanger ending .
there 's not much that 's original
about i still know , and with the market saturated by gen - x thrillers like this one , it 's unlikely that i still know will get any recognition other than that of a bad sequel
.
for die - hard fans of the genre , this will be required viewing material , but the bottom line is that the material here is just recycled from the original
i know what you did last summer .
the aura of thrillerism surrounding the plot is n't heightened by skillful scripting or camera work , but rather a tense , string - based score and manipulative editing .
the man with the hook ends up becoming very belittled this time around when the script gives him too many lines of dialogue
-- he goes from being a scary figure to a nutcase in a few short and painful moments .
much of the mystery is dropped for the sake of getting the point .
the whole reason the plot exists - julie and karla must guess the capital of brazil in order to win the trip from the radio station - is a dead giveaway , lessening suspense and creating a hurry - up - and - wait timing problem .
and , whereas the killer 's identity might 've been a question in the first movie , it 's almost a given here , which changes the dynamic of the movie drastically .
three or four teens run automatically from a man in a rain slicker they nonchalantly refer to as "" the killer .
""
they 're almost used to it , and the performances show it - not hewitt , nor prinze , nor brandy , nor phifer give a decent show
.
and so , in the end , it 's left wide open for a third movie and - most likely - a brand new supporting cast .
god help us .",0,"['gives him too many lines of dialogue', 'now seems trite and overplayed when paired with this abominable thriller', 'a dead giveaway , lessening suspense and creating a hurry - up - and - wait timing problem', ""there 's not much that 's original"", ""a shoddy product that 's exposed for the cash - milking vehicle it really is"", 'god help us', 'just recycled from the original', 'a few short and painful moments', 'not hewitt , nor prinze , nor brandy , nor phifer give a decent show', ""is n't heightened by skillful scripting or camera work , but rather a tense , string - based score and manipulative editing"", 'a bad sequel']"

a favourite book of mine called the golden turkey awards relates the story that when mommie dearest was unleashed upon unsuspecting audiences back in 1981 , paramount soon realised they had a problem on their hands .
it was n't just the film 's disappointing box office performance .
indeed , in the coming years some people would be going back to see it two , three , even six times .
no , the main problem was that what was intended as a serious biopic of screen queen joan crawford was turning into the laugh riot of the year .
in a desperate attempt to capitalise on this unexpected turn of events , some publicity hacks dreamed up outrageous print advertisements screaming : "" mommie dearest : the biggest mommie of them all ! "" .
executives at paramount were appalled and soon had the ads withdrawn , but it was all too late .
mommie dearest was already cementing its place in camp cinema history .
unfortunately , faye dunaway 's energetic , at times ridiculously over - the - top performance is about the film 's only redeeming feature .
based on daughter christina crawford 's trashy biography , mommie dearest chronicles a series of mainly private events in the life of her moviestar mother .
if you believe this movie , it was a life was racked by obsession , lonliness , child abuse and rampant egomania .
the film begins with crawford adopting two children , and concludes in the office of her lawyer where her now grown - up daughter and son find out they have been left out of their mother 's will .
joan always wanted her kids to be able to fend for themselves , you see .
but that 's about the only thread in the narrative that manages to survive to the film 's end .
the script - laboured over by four writers , a bad sign in itself - is a poorly connected series of episodes that builds little dramatic momentum .
frank perry 's direction is no more than competent , and
dunaway 's bitchy lines aside ,
the dialogue is flat and uninvolving .
in fairness , the film 's second half ditches some of the cartoon hysterics and does develop a degree empathy for its characters .
when the adult christina moves out of home into her own modest dwelling , joan visits and keeps in touch , not helping her financially but encouraging christina 's own acting and career ambitions .
crawford does seem to care about her daughter , but you can sense the emotional distance and feel some of their pain .
you also get glimpses of what the film could have been in the hands of better writers .
ah , but there is dunaway 's performance . and what a delicious piece of campery
it often is . having just been sacked by her studio after a run of box office duds , crawford storms home late at night and proceeds to go ballistic in the garden .
she has the maid drag the kids out of bed to come down and clean up the mess she 's making .
spotting a young tree she does n't like the look of , she turns to the trembling christina and utters the immortal line "" tina ! !
fetch me the axe ! !
"" with which she proceeds to enthusiastically dismember the poor sapling .
in the film 's most outrageous scene , joan realises that some of her daughter 's clothes are hanging on wire coat hangers .
oh dear ! sounds like the perfect excuse for another temper tantrum , does n't it ?
this time she gives her daughter a horrible beating while delivering another classic outburst : "" no . . .
wire . . .
hangers .
. . . ever ! ! ! !
"" .
and later , when the board of her late husband 's company pepsi cola tries to divest her of her directorship
, she displays a superb grasp of business etiquette by jumping to her feet and roaring : "" do n't fuck with me , fellas ! ! "" .
oh joy !
something of a camp classic , then , but
if that 's not you 're
cup of tea then mommie dearest
does n't have too much to recommend it .
better you see the real crawford in the women ( 1939 ) , mildred pierce ( 1945 ) or whatever happened to baby jane ( 1962 ) .
great films distinguished by great performances , and a far more eloquent testament to this great woman than frank perry 's shrieking piece of tabloid froth .",0,"['direction is no more than competent', 'was already cementing its place in camp cinema history', 'oh joy ! something of a camp classic', 'a bad sign in itself', ""does n't have too much to recommend it"", 'the dialogue is flat and uninvolving', 'shrieking piece of tabloid froth', 'what a delicious piece of campery']"
""" pokemon 3 : the movie "" has a lot of bad things in it .
first of all it 's a plot heavy mess that has bad voice talents , badly written script and fantastic animation .
the first film came out the end of 1999 and was a huge hit grossing almost $ 90 million domestically .
a sequel soon followed and even made $ 45 million .
warner has released their third movie based on the immensely popular video game and tv series and its a waste of time and celluloid .
this time ash ketchum and his friends are on their way to the johto battles ( which my little brother told me the new spinoff is "" pokemon : the johto journeys "" so go figure )
anyway he comes in contact with a young girl who 's father has disappeared after trying to discover the unown .
they are small pokemon with a powerful punch and have great psychic abilities .
the unown bring together their psychic abilities and create entei a powerful legendary pokemon who barriers young molly 's house and creates every wish she wants .
now it 's up to ash and his friends to stop this pokemon entei and show him to be a good pokemon rather than a bad one . too bad really that this is a bad movie , surprisingly the first movie was entertaining and somewhat absorbing , the second was a piece of trash and this one is almost in between .
it has some good qualities ( animation , message in the end ) but the flaws seem to overpower the goods
.
i 'm still not sure what the big thing is about pokemon , they are ugly little animals who speak their own name for their language ( besides meowth , my personal favorite ) and you do n't understand what they are saying .
my little brother just thought the movie was amazing , and i kept leaning over and asking him happened , or what pokemon that was .
his response was a big lecture of how this is that , and that is this . . .
he sure did put me in my place .
with the second and third movie being bad , i have a feeling pokemon 4 : the movie might be a total bust as well .

the animal "" is a marginally inspired comedy that only manages to lumber along , generating just enough momentum to keep it from stalling .
it 's clunky and slow , like watching an 18-wheeler trying to accelerate up a hill .
there are certainly better things you can do with your time .
actually , if you 've seen the trailer , then you already know the plot and have seen its funniest moments .
the story centers on bland marvin ( rob schneider ) , who is an evidence clerk at the local police department that yearns to be a real officer .
but he 's afflicted with loser - itis .
dogs attack him
, neighbors torment him , children bully him , and his co - workers ignore him .
truthfully , with his bad haircut ( seemingly modeled after weird al yankovic , little richard , and giant poodles ) and his unenthusiastic demeanor , we 'd probably throw tomatoes at him just for fun .
this is actually bad because you ca n't like a character if you ca n't develop sympathy for him .
we never do , and it may be just as well that he drives off a cliff and plummets to the canyon floor .
however , marvin is found by an eccentric doctor ( michael caton ) who uses a radical and experimental procedure to save him , implanting our doofus with various animal parts and organs .
as a result , marvin develops heightened senses and increased agility and speed .
he can smell drugs hidden anywhere on a body , swim with the speed of a dolphin , and can run as fast as a cheetah .
imagine the comedic possibilities that arise from this operation .
with his enhanced abilities , he could now reap vengeance on all those who have shunned him .
however , the spirit of the film takes a raunchy turn , and instead , marvin spends most of his time trying to subdue or satiate his voracious appetite and his animalistic , sexual urges .
goats beware !
he also chases cats , urinates to mark his territory , or growls at his enemies .
what he should 've done was stick his head in the sand like an ostrich .
equally tenuous is its other running joke , which involves one of his friends ( guy torry ) who constantly complains that everyone is treating him too nicely because he 's black .
""
it 's reverse racism , "" he declares as he blows smoke into the faces of strangers but none of them says anything .
this element does n't work the first time it 's mentioned , and it becomes increasingly trite with every recurrence .
you do n't have to be as wise as an owl to realize that "" the animal "" is tame .
if there 's any reason to see this film , it 's to see colleen haskell who makes her big screen debut .
remember her ?
she was voted off in week 11 of the 13-week program , "" survivor .
""
here , she plays marvin 's sunny love interest .
while her role required very little actual acting , she seemed very comfortable ( even when marvin licks the side of her face like a lapping dog . . .
yuck ! )
.
with her adorable disposition , radiant smile , and playful innocence , she could be a meg ryan in the making .

"there 's a moment in schindler 's list when a number of jews are trudging through snow , clean and crisp , dark edges and frost on the ground .
one girl waltzes through , wearing a red dress that stings the eyes .
it is probably the finest moment through out the film .
when i first saw it i began to cry , though i could not say why .
this landscape is the setting of many small moments that add up to one big whole .
when one man is shot in the head we see blood oozing out onto the ground -- so black and murky , its almost pomegranate red .
at another time we follow a young boy as he runs , searching for a hiding spot before finally squeezing into a toilet -- which is already occupied .
like so ( citizen kane , fargo , the godfather , the godfather part ii , greed , ) many of the greatest american films , schindler 's list plays with the concepts of money , power , and soul .
but this is a movie about a man who does the right thing .
starkly emotional , and brutally powerful , schindler 's list strips away everything on the outset and leaves us ony feelings .
the following that it has gained is not suprising -- this is probably , thus far , the best film of the decade .
steven spielberg has always been a skilfull filmmaker -- his assured hand churned out both jurassic parks , jaws , the indiana jones films , and e .
t .
-- but it was n't until 1993 that we saw what a brilliant man he can be .
the product of his genuis is really something to see -- it can bring tears to your eyes just as it uplifts you .
throughout , we sense the deep control which he so masterfully spreads .
we watch oskar schindler ( liam neeson ) grow from an arrogant , self important man who hires jews only to save money into a moving figure , with a deep sense of pride and accomplishment .
the film requires much work , and can be a harrowing experience -- go expecting a quick entertainment
and you 'll be bitterly dissapointed .
it does reward the patient viewer .
this is a mature spielberg , and his deft hands shape an absoloute masterpiece .
this eqsuisite , beautiful film is a rare gem .
it does a good job of summarizing why i love movies .
it leaves one breathless , uplifted , and with much to think about .
afterwards you can reflect on individual images , visions , and people .
laconic , removed , schindler strides through the film a detached prescence who watches all , does much , and leaves feeling as if he could , should , have done more
then he did and was able to .
the change seems natural -- in the hands of a lesser filmmaker , it would be crude and would cheat the audience .
instead we are told a tale , told a story .
the film is punishing to watch , yes .
but anyone who allows themselves to get involved will experience a miracle , and a genuine masterpiece of a movie .",1,"['a skilfull filmmaker', 'it does reward the patient viewer . this is a mature spielberg , and his deft hands shape an absoloute masterpiece . this eqsuisite , beautiful film is a rare gem . it does a good job of summarizing why i love movies . it leaves one breathless , uplifted , and with much to think about', ""starkly emotional , and brutally powerful , schindler 's list strips away everything on the outset and leaves us ony feelings . the following that it has gained is not suprising -- this is probably , thus far , the best film of the decade"", 'will experience a miracle , and a genuine masterpiece of a movie', 'a brilliant man']"
"being that it is a foreign language film with no known names with a select number theaters showing it , "" shall we dance "" wo n't be seen by that many people .
and that 's a shame
- this is a funny , enchanting , and goofy movie full of laughs , surprises , and wonderful dance sequences .
the surprising thing about "" shall we dance "" is the universal appeal of the story .
a us version is in the works , and it 's no wonder -
it 's not really all that culture specific .
although there is a narrated set - up that adds some extra resonance to the proceedings ( about the view the japanese culture has about ballroom dancing ) , the movie is so rich in character and appeal that this added layer is n't at all necessary to understand or enjoy the film .
the only important unexplained japanese - specific reference that may leave some a bit puzzled is that 1000 yen is roughly $ 10 ( when you see the film - and you should see this film - you 'll know why ) . a middle aged company man realizes that achieving all the goals he set for himself in life ( a house , a child , and good marriage ) still does n't translate into a fulfilled life .
after glimpsing a melancholy beauty looking out from a dance studio window while on the train home from work , sugiyana ( koji yakusho ) decides after some trepidation to take up ballroom dance lessons in order to meet the woman who has stirred something in himself .
after finding the weekly fees for private lessons from the elegant and beautiful mai ( tamiyo kusakari ) too rich for his blood , sugiyama opts for groups lessons simply to be near her .
we then meet the players in this gem of a movie , who all have their own reasons for joining the class .
later on , we meet aoki at the dance studio ( naoto takenaka ) , a co - worker and all out weirdo and one of the laugh riot highlights of the film .
the story , laughs , and touching scenes evolve as the movie goes along .
it 's a pleasure to watch such a wonderful film that is propelled almost solely by the characters and performances .
it 's difficult to explain the charms of the film without revealing too much - the movie abounds with little revelations that subtly shape the characters , and in the end , each one is that much fuller and more understood by the time you leave the theater .
it 's one of those movies that only the french seem to make anymore - no big plot , no special effects , no gunplay , no tragic consequences , no forced examinations of the nature of love , and no insights into the nature of evil .
just a warm , funny , endearing film that will charm the pants off of you .
when was the last time you left a theater feeling all warm and fuzzy inside ?

"synopsis : sullen julie james , still haunted by nightmares of the killer ben willis from
i know what you did last summer , perks up when her new best friend karla wilson wins a trip for four to the bahamas .
arriving at the start of the hurricane season , julie and karla run around in very tight clothing and realize they 've walked into a trap set by the rainslickered slasher with a huge hook for a hand .
comments : i may be showing some pop culture illiteracy here , but i have never seen an episode of the fox tv series "" party of five .
""
i am only vaguely aware of the show 's premise , and my knowledge of it comes from brief commercials
i half - paid attention to while watching the tube .
"" party of five , "" i do know however , seems to be the starting ground for actresses in the teen horror genre .
neve campbell , scream queen of the 90s and star of scream , scream 2 , and the craft , is a regular of the show .
so too is jennifer love hewitt .
lo and behold , following in the footsteps of campbell , hewitt now has a horror franchise of her own : the i know what you did last summer line .
though the original film , released last year , was watchable enough , this insipid sequel had me looking at the theater 's glowing red exit sign longingly throughout .
jennifer love hewitt is a very good - looking young leading lady ; however , unlike neve campbell , hewitt struggles with acting .
she just is n't convincing in this film ( and she was n't in the original either ) .
this puts many young males , including myself , in a paradoxical quandary : she 's very attractive , but the annoying , spoiled , valley girl - type character she tries to play here is annoying to the extreme and ruins many of the scenes which emphasize , exploitatively , her figure .
add to the mix the equally pleasant yet irritating brandy , another rising teen tv star , and you get one frustrated male audience .
i 've spent so much time on hewitt and brandy for a reason .
i still know what you did last summer , though cashing in on the success of the original , ultimately serves as a vehicle for these two young actresses .
nothing else here is original or interesting .
this movie , in fact , makes other recent so - so horror films like urban legend and john carpenter 's vampires seem like stunning works of high art .
i still know relies heavily on tired slasher film cliches : an isolated location , a storm , parentless teenagers , false alarm nightmares , lots of blue - lighted darkness scenes , a garbed slasher who walks around in the background without the characters seeing him , knives and other sharp instruments lying around everywhere , etc .
you get the picture .
the entire audience knows all the secondary characters introduced in the film are going to receive the business end of the killer 's hook .
they may as well have huge targets painted on them .
like scream and its numerous knockoffs , these secondary characters are supposed to serve as comic relief .
unfortunately , i still know 's characters are n't all that funny
.
in particular , one character , a chain - weed - smoking guy , is obnoxiously annoying and certainly does n't die soon enough .
the death scenes , by the way , are relatively violent for a theatrically released horror film .
several of them are uncomfortable to watch , and they reminded me of the sickening gore scenes in hellraiser :
bloodline , a truly sadistic movie .
this , too , did not help the supposed humor i still know was shooting for .
and what is the deal with the slasher himself ?
i know that the slasher film is not a particularly intelligent genre , but ben willis has got to go down as one of the most silly slashers in mainstream horror .
come on , the guy looks like the gorton 's fisherman , and his gruff voice makes him sound like a disney pirate . though his lightning - lit appearances ellicited much - needed laughter in the theater , his appearance borders on the absurd in the horror film , and that 's
* really * saying something .
so , all that 's left to talk about here is jennifer love hewitt and brandy .
both prance about in tightfitting , revealing outfits or in various states of undress , yet neither of them ever actually do a nude scene .
hewitt , however , does do a post - shower scene in which her thin bathrobe is quite . . .
titillating .
this scene alone made this one - star turkey earn two stars under my rating system .
otherwise , hewitt and brandy both grate on the nerves .
early in the film , for instance , brandy wins the trip to the bahamas .
she and hewitt jump around and scream and screech for what seems like forever .
i needed extra - strength tylenol after that part .
oh , and the film 's conclusion
, talk about repetitive !
people who saw i know what you did last summer will predict i still know 's ending at least 5 minutes before it happens .
boring !
i saw this movie with my brother at the local downtown movie theater .
admission is only one dollar on wednesdays , and we often go see bad movies on these days just to ridicule them .
it 's usually a fun thing to do along with the rest of the audience , who do n't seem to mind participating in a mass "" mystery science theater 3000 "" -type viewing .
i still know what you did last summer , however , produced several lengthy uncomfortable silences from the audience , underscoring how bad it * really * is . if it were n't for the main actresses ' revealing wardrobes , i 'd have had a very , very hard time sitting through this lame sequel .
i ca n't imagine trying to watch it on video ( horror films seem 10 times better in a theater because they rely heavily on audience participation ) and would n't recommend it to people , unless they 're horror film fanatics or huge fans of hewitt and brandy .
i read on a website somewhere that another sequel is already in the works .
what a depressing thought .
hewitt apparently needs to spend more time on tv figuring out how to act .
rated r , this film contains lots of violence , several gory scenes , and a couple nubile , horny teenagers -- though the sex act itself is always thwarted .
i 'd say this is unsuitable for kids , but teens would n't have a problem sitting through it , especially since they obviously compose the film 's target audience .",0,"['both grate on the nerves', 'struggles with acting', ""unfortunately , i still know 's characters are n't all that funny"", 'produced several lengthy uncomfortable silences from the audience , underscoring how bad it * really * is', 'talk about repetitive !', 'nothing else here is original or interesting', ""this insipid sequel had me looking at the theater 's glowing red exit sign longingly throughout"", 'boring !', ""would n't recommend it to people"", 'annoying to the extreme and ruins many of the scenes', ""obnoxiously annoying and certainly does n't die soon enough"", 'his gruff voice makes him sound like a disney pirate']"
"i 'm an avid fan of the "" alien "" saga , so this review is obviously a tad biased ( at least i admitted it ) .
of course , that does n't mean that i 'm gon na be giving this a four - star review or something , because "" alien : resurrection , "" the fourth film in the cool - as - hell series is not an absolutely amazing film , much like the first two were . however ,
it 's a very good film which never fails to entertain , and consists of yet another mutation in the style of the series .
in short , i had a good time .
"" alien : resurrection "" leaves off 200 years after the last one , where our heroine protagonist , ellen ripley ( sigourney weaver ) , the science fiction genre 's answer to job , had killed herself after discovering that an alien was inside her body , waiting to pop out like it did to john hurt in the first one .
of course , the last one was n't very great or anything
( i liked it , though not as much as the first two ) , and more importantly , it was n't financially successful ( a tawdry 55 million bucks ! )
.
so back we are , with ripley back as a clone , which means we get another little satirical look at cloning ( not that that 's a bad thing , but it 's becoming a cliche ) .
so she 's cloned aboard an even more futuristic - looking ship called "" the auriga "" by some doctors ( including the necessary bad government guy , dr .
wren , played by j .
e . freeman , as well as the little - seen dr .
gediman , played by none other than brad douriff ) , mainly because they have a version of her with the alien still inside her .
once you get past the fact that you ca n't figure out where they got her blood ( although i think it might have been from the blood samples taken by charles dance in the third one ) ,
the film 's okay .
also on board are a band of mercenary pirates , including michael wincott , ron perlman , kim flowers , raymond cruz , dominique pinon ( a jeunet sytable ) and . . . winona ryder , who plays analee call , who turns out to have a bit of a secret
( i wo n't state it , but unless you 've been shacking up with salinger for the past two years , you probably know all about it - although it 's nicely covered up ) .
there 's a bit of a non - sexual - yet - slightly - homoerotic relationship between her and ripley , but it 's never really deepened enough .
oh well .
well , as you might have guessed , the alien and its spawn escape and run around the ship .
and it pretty much does away with most of the people on the ship ( including some shocks - dan hedaya , for instance , who 's death is comical yet sad since
, well , he 's dan hedaya ) , and the remaining people ( about 7 or 8 ) are left to try and escape and stop the aliens from doing any major harm since the ship is heading quickly towards earth .
of course , the plot is all balderdash , and just an excuse for some good old "" alien "" -brand fun .
the real focus of the series seems to be on style , not really substance ( although there 's always a bit of it , most notably in "" aliens "" with the relationship between ripley and the little girl ) .
what 's interesting about the series is that each film is stylistically different in its approach .
"" alien "" is a claustrophobic exercise in quiet frights .
"" aliens "" is a wild , tense thriller .
"" alien 3 "" is a bleak , moody piece of semi - noir .
"" alien 4 "" is kind of like an off - beat french film , filled with lots of humor , and cool scares .
jean - pierre jeunet ( without his usual directing partner , marc caro ) creates a ship filled with the kind of scares films like "" das boot "" has , with echoes hinting at a possible threat .
the chills in the film are really cool , especially with the music , which is sometimes turned down completely for certain scenes ( there 's the most tense surgery scene since "" face / off "" towards the beginning ) .
and not every chill turns into a bloody mess or anything like that .
this all combined with some good old humor makes this as interesting visually and stylistically as the others .
there are even a couple scenes which just stick out afterwards as being brilliantly executed .
one is the aforementioned surgery scene .
another one takes place between call and ripley , which is just awesome .
the underwater chase scene and the ladder scene afterwards is one of the most tense , thrilling , and jaw - dropping scenes in the entire saga ( with a small allusion to jeunet 's earlier film , "" delicatessen "" ) .
and the way they do in the final alien is hysterically cool ( with a lovely allusion to "" goldfinger "" ) .
but the best scene in the entire film ( i 'm sure i 'm not the first to mention it ) takes place when ripley sees all the variations on her as they cloned her
( she has a an "" 8 "" tatooed on her arm ) .
it might be the most emotionally stimulating scene in the entire saga .
the screenplay by joss whedon is not a great piece of work , as it never really deapens a lot of the characters .
however , it does make us care about most of them , so that when there 's very little of them , and it looks like one or more of them may become alien chow
, we are pretty scared .
and , yeah , there are some very funny lines ( ripley :
"" who do i have to fuck to get off this boat ? !
"" johner : "" well , i can get you off .
but not this ship .
"" ) the acting is good all around , with stand - out performances from ron perlman as the male chauvenist pig johner , and leland orser ( the poor bastad in "" se7en "" who performed the "" lust "" sin ) as an anxiety - ridden wannabe woody allen who has an alien inside him .
winona ryder is good , but not amazing like she usually is ( although she meshes well with the film ) .
of course , and as usual , sigourney weaver steals the show .
playing a variation on the ripley character ( less emotional , and more rude and bitter ) , she pulls it off while still being utterly lovable .
she 's not going to get an oscar nomination
like she did for "" aliens ,
"" but she 's just awesome .
overall , it 's a thrilling , entertaining film which does n't really amaze like the first two , but is much more amazing than the third installment .
the style is the best part of the film , which is n't really a bad thing , but it being the best part takes away from a lot of the depth the film occasionally tries to apply .
but it 's entertaining as hell ,
and it 's definitely fit for the "" alien "" series .",1,"[""it 's a very good film which never fails to entertain"", 'the chills in the film are really cool', 'i had a good time', ""it 's entertaining as hell"", ""she 's just awesome"", 'a thrilling , entertaining film', 'the best part of the film', 'brilliantly executed', 'some good old humor', 'as interesting visually and stylistically', 'the acting is good all around', 'steals the show', 'one of the most tense , thrilling , and jaw - dropping scenes', 'stand - out performances', 'much more amazing']"

"i do n't know how many other people have had the idea cross their mind that their life could be an ongoing television show watched by another world of people , but it 's something i used to wonder about when i was younger .
i ca n't decide if i first thought it because i watched a lot of tv or because my brother hit me in the head with a baseball bat , but i 'm pretty sure andrew niccol , screenwriter for the truman show , has had the same curious thought .
the truman show is about a man ( jim carrey ) whose entire life has been engineered by a corporation and marketed to the public .
since birth , he 's been living in the fictional island town of seahaven , fla . , which actually exists as a giant domed set just beyond the hollywood sign .
all the people in truman burbank 's life are actors , and the anonymous townfolk paid extras .
people watch truman 's life 24 hours a day , live , with no commercial interruptions .
revenue comes instead from product placement , a staple of contemporary hollywood , with truman 's friends and relatives describing their consumer items in cheerful and optimistic tones .
the sun rises and sets on cue and everyone likes everyone else .
even if you have n't seen the truman show , you 've probably learned most of the crucial details from the commercials , the trailer and other promotion blitzes .
if anything i 've written so far is a surprise to you , then i pity you for making me a primary source for your entertainment news .
either way , you should probably know the premise of the truman show going into it , because otherwise you 'll probably think it sucks .
it begins with jim carrey looking into a mirror , reciting the crucial "" eat me "" scene from alive , wishing his neighbors a good day , afternoon and evening , and living in domestic bliss with his wife ( laura linney ) .
but weird things start happening .
a stage light comes falling out of the sky , truman hears people tracking his movements on the radio and he swears he sees his dead father .
we learn through a flashback that his father drowned when truman was a child , sailing through a rainstorm .
the death was staged by director christof ( ed harris ) , who wanted to put a fear of water into truman to keep him from leaving the island .
similar cruel manipulations keep him from stumbling upon the truth , not the least of them truman 's best friend marlon ( noah emmerich ) , who assures him he 's not in on any conspiracy because the last thing he 'd ever do is hurt him .
as truman 's trusting eyes tear over , christof fades up emotional synthesizer music for a worldwide audience of people who apparently never watch anything else .
there 's even a daily behind - the - scenes update from harry shearer that captures the highlights of truman 's existence .
the key to a movie like this is in finding the right balance between humor and drama , because a premise like this has its obvious implications in both directions .
and it all hinges on carrey , who has to balance comic naivet with a real sense of longing and drive to find out what the hell is going on .
he 's come a long way from talking butt cheeks in ace ventura .
most fundamentally , it 's just plain interesting to follow along as director peter weir shows us just how they can capture a person 's life without the person realizing it -- how they coordinate extras , hide cameras and feed automatic lines to actors .
the most interesting thing about the truman show is that most of us can probably imagine some ambitious director pitching a show like this .
sure , the most interesting tv genre of the ' 90s has been reality programming and jerry springer 's popularity is through the roof , but those people deserve to be humiliated for turning their intimate details over to the airwaves . and when news shows use hidden cameras , it 's done in the name of the greater good , not entertainment . but merge the two and you 've got the truman show .
right now , it 's implausible -- i mean , the fcc wo n't let you say the s - word on the air ; do you think they 'd let you broadcast every detail of a man 's life to the entire world without his consent ?
one day , though , it could happen .
and , even though it would mean the end of privacy , people would eat it up .
you know they would .",1,"['the most interesting thing', 'finding the right balance', ""he 's come a long way""]"
"the most absurd remake of 1998 ?
it 's a toss up between gus van sant 's psycho and mighty joe young , the new disney picture based on the old rko picture .
( i knew i was in trouble when a polished , computer - generated version of that famous rko logo appeared before the head credits . )
there is no great demand for another giant ape movie - make that ape movie , period .
( witness the quick deaths of buddy , born to be wild and congo . )
and while this latest entry is inoffensive and watchable , it 's also an assembly line product through and through , lacking the charm and unpredictability of the jungle serials that partly inspired it .
theron is jill young : as a young girl in the wilds of africa , she befriended a baby gorilla after both their mothers were slain by poachers .
that baby gorilla ( nicknamed joe ) grows to immense proportions , and adult jill basically bides her time looking after him , playing hide and seek with him and guarding him against poachers .
enter conservationist greg ( paxton ) , who convinces jill to move with joe to california , where they can protect him better in a controlled environment .
joe is restless at first ; no sooner does he finally settle in to the new place than those nasty poachers show up in l . a . , plotting joe 's demise .
suffice it to say , the movie could have been called "" joe : ape in the city .
"" theron ( so good in devil 's advocate ) and paxton ( so good in the recent a simple plan ) are fine actors , but not fine enough to transcend the material , a paint - by - numbers script from the hack writers of superman iv and mercury rising .
the plot arguably borrows more from steven spielberg 's the lost world than the 1949 original , with the computer - generated t - rex - i mean , joe - wreaking havoc on the busy streets for an encore ; the storytelling becomes especially lazy during this final third , with jill shouting , "" look , joe 's headed for the movie theatre ! "" followed by a shot of joe scaling mann 's chinese theater ; a moment later , jill shouts again something like "" look , joe 's headed for an amusement park ! "" and what do you know , there 's joe at the pallisades carnival , scaring the bejesus out of innocent thrillseekers .
the seams of last - minute edits to mighty joe young show - unrelated scenes are patched together with quick dissolves .
the movie sure feels uneven , regardless : act two is underdeveloped , while a little of joe smashing cars in act three goes a long , long way .
underwood ( tremors , speechless ) was perhaps not the director for the job ; even the plentiful , untamed landscape looks dull in his hands .
( capturing the beauty of nature requires more than his point and shoot style . )
i did enjoy certain sequences , especially the demoliton of a black - tie dinner sequence ; and the prologue , however implausible , is touching .

rick baker 's make - up effects and puppetry are outstanding , the real star of the show - yet , for all its technical flawlessness , the creature remains too grumpy and homicidal to love .
( his facial expressions are variations on a scowl . ) to be fair , i saw mighty joe young in a cinema packed with wailing children - it 's a wonder i was able to decipher the dialogue .
it 's certainly not a film for very young kids - intense fighting scenes may scare them , while any time joe 's not on camera may bore them to tears .
( note : older boys are more likely to be dazzled by theron 's colourful array of tank tops . )
i suspect bland mighty joe young is passable entertainment for a family outing , but they sure do n't make ?

christian slater , who is much better in his tender roles as in untamed heart , plays tom .
edward asner drops by briefly to take on the role of the soon to be dead charlie .
coming to their "" rescue "" is a gang headed by jim , played on autopilot by the great actor morgan freeman .
he views the loot , three million dollars worth , as his retirement plan .
the entire movie is one big watery chase with the sheriff and his posse tracking jim and his gang , who are in turn after tom .
along the way , tom picks up a love interest in the person of a crucifix - weapon wielding woman named karen , played in a totally wasted performance by minnie driver .
the action sequences are repetitive and without much interest .
they do feature lots of explosions and gunfire to keep you awake .
christopher young 's emotionless score
for the film has a single trait , ear - shattering loudness .
the plot holes are as big as the ones in the dam that breaks , submerging the town .
the characters have an infinite number of bullets and rarely do they have to bother reloading their guns .
the weapons and the ammunition spend most of the time under water or being rained on but always fire perfectly .
when one of the bad guys drops a gun into the water , it stays in the same place until much later when tom swims to get it , even though the swift water is so strong it is uprooting large trees .
counting these improbabilities is one of the more enjoyable ways to spend your time as you wait for the characters to kill each other .
the show has a single , but unprintable , good line .
betty white plays an incessantly bossy wife , and , when her hen - pecked husband finally told her off , our audience roared with laughter .
the show concludes with a sickening set of twists .
the best that can be said of the picture is that it is merely stupefyingly awful as opposed to laughably bad .
hard rain runs 1 : 37 .
it is rated r for violence and would be fine for teenagers .

"in present day hanoi , three sisters reflect on their parents ' relationship while trying to define their own in writer / director tran anh hung 's ( "" the scent of green papaya "" ) "" the vertical ray of the sun .
""
youngest sister lien ( tran nu yen - khe ) greets the day with hai ( ngo quanq hai ) , the only brother whom she rooms and relentlessly flirts with .
their morning ritual of tai chi and lou reed precedes crossing the street to eldest sister suong 's ( nguyen nhu quynh )
cafe , where lien works , for breakfast .
the three sisters lovingly prepare their mother 's memorial banquet of traditional delicacies , prepared as much for look as taste , while giggling over the differences between the sexes .
after the family breaks from the banquet , we learn that suong 's young son ' little monkey ' is doted upon , but there 's a distance developing with her husband quoc ( chu ngoc hung ) , who 's leaving for one of his habitual botanical photography trips .

she 's pregnant before he leaves on a trip to saigon to research tuan , a mysterious man in his mother - in - law 's past .
lien keeps crawling into hai 's bed at night , causing him to fall out of it .
the initial serenity we witnessed starts turning into a soap opera before coming to full circle one month later , as the three women prepare their father 's memorial banquet .

the vertical ray of the sun "" is a contemplative piece where strong passions exist underneath calm exteriors .
sly humor , self deceit and harsh truths
all exist in the cyclic screenplay .
tran anh hung and his cinematographer mark
lee ping - bin ( "" flowers of shanghai "" ) linger over and repeat the small gestures of everyday life - a wife washes her husbands hands , a woman makes water dance in a bowl , a man pulls his lover to face him before they part .
small spaces such as rooms , alleys and courtyards create intimacy .
the color green , symbolizing life and tranquility , is used heavily in the film 's visual styling , lapsing into yellowish hues and blues .

anh hung 's film recalls
ang lee 's "" eat drink man woman , "" another tale of three sisters of varying modernity coming together traditionally for a parent .
but while lee 's more traditionally story - driven film resulted in radical changes for all concerned , "" the vertical ray of the sun 's "" characters strive for peaceful harmony .
